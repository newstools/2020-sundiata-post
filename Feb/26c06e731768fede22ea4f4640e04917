Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, has revealed plans to sue President Muhammadu Buhari over his refusal to sack service chiefs. Femi Falana made this known during an interview with Channel Television, where he said the heads of security agencies in the country had exceeded the 35 years in service allowed by law. The Nigerian government had insisted that the service chiefs would not be sacked despite calls from different quarters. Speaking during the interview, Falana said; “Under public service rule, under the harmonised rules for military officers in Nigeria and under Section 6 of the Armed Forces Act, which empowers the President to make rules and regulations for the military, there is no provision for extension of tenure (for service chiefs) beyond the period stipulated by law. “It has been done in the past but that does not make it right. There is equality before the law, so you can’t extend the service of certain officers while you ask others to go after 35 years of service or the attainment of 60 years of age. “To the best of my knowledge, a suit will be filed during the week, in respect of this matter. “The President must be prevailed upon to appreciate that we may also be undergoing what you might describe as internal sabotage (in the fight against insurgency) by many members of the armed forces who simply feel since these are the people who can stop insurgency or terrorism, let them go ahead. Because the Chief of Army Staff himself has had an occasion to accuse members of the armed forces of not doing enough.” Source
