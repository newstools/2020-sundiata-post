Hamburg – Hamburg, was on Wednesday hit by a powerful storm, which police said flooded the port city’s famous fish market and several streets around the harbour. According to the Federal Maritime Agency, water levels in the city were 2.76 metres above Mean High Water (MHW), which calculates an average for daily high tides. No one was reported injured but several cars had to be removed from the deluge. The Hamburg fish market is an institution dating back to 1703, attracting early risers as well as the city’s after-party crowd every Sunday morning with its offering of traditional fish sandwiches. The state of Schleswig-Holstein on Germany’s North Sea coast was also impacted by the storm surge, with water levels recorded at around 1.5 metres above MHW in the region. The local police however, reported that no flooding or damage recorded so far. (dpa/NAN)
