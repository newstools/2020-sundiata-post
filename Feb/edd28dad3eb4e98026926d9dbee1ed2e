Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Ike Onyema couldn’t hide his happiness at the housewarming party of his lover, Mercy Eke on Monday. There are still rumours that the duo may have called it quit, though it is still unconfirmed. During the party, the model was spotted whispering something into the curvy video vixen’s ear as she leaned into his arms and she was heard jokingly telling him to go away. In another video, the model stopped Mercy from taking a photo with co-reality star, Omashola. On the 29th of December 2019, Mercy had announced that she will be celebrating her housewarming party while marking that the Sunday of the year. The BBNaija winner got embroiled in a controversy after she revealed she bought her home at the sum of 75million from realtor, Ned Okonkwo. After giving her fans alias Mercenaries a tour round her Lekki house, she hosted a couple of her close friends and treated them to a party where Ike couldn’t keep his eyes and hands off her.
