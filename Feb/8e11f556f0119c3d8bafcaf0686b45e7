Folu Adeboye, wife of the General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye has spoken to mothers about how they should train their children and the need for them to learn how to cook. Recall that a few days ago, Twitter users dragged Pastor Adeboye online after he asked men to marry only women who can cook. He had tweeted: “My sons, don’t marry a lady who cannot cook. She needs to know how to do chores and cook because you cannot afford to be eating out all the time. “My sons, don’t marry a girl who is worldly. If you do, you have carried what you’ll worship for the rest of your life. Pastor E. A. Adeboye.” His words have now been backed by Folu Adeboye who advised women to ensure they teach their kids how to cook. She told a congregation: “As anointed women, we must teach our children to cook, they can’t keep eating at a restaurant everyday of their live. Women teach your children to cook & eat at home, they can’t eat out all the time”. Source
