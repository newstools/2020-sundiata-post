Until recently, Islam had been perceived with deep skepticism and mistrust in Igboland. This is not unusual for Igbos given the fact that they also had deep mistrust and skepticism for Christianity when the Europeans first introduced it to the region almost two centuries ago. Evidence however points to a change in that trend in Igboland towards Islam. In Ebonyi state, the religion has grown so much that the state has become the first in the region to launch a Muslim Pilgrims welfare board. In Owerri, the local adherents in the state recently built a Jumuat mosque with donations from members, see picture below: So what do you think? Are Igbos slowly accepting Islam? Is it good for her people?
