The Imo State Government has approved immediate implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage in the State Public Service. A release issued by the Chief Press Secretary/ Media Adviser to Governor Hope Uzodinma, Oguwike Nwachuku, said the payment of the minimum wage would be for the least paid worker on Grade level 1 Step 1. The release said consequential adjustments on other levels would be implemented as soon as the ongoing Government-Labour negotiations were concluded. It would be recalled that at a recent meeting Governor Uzodinma had with labour leaders in the state, he promised the payment of the N30,000 minimum wage if all the negotiations with them were concluded.
