Erfurt (Germany) – An organisation representing Jewish people in the German state of Thuringia, on Thursday, said it was deeply troubled by the fact that the state Premier was elected with the help of far-right votes. The Head of the Jewish Community of Thuringia, Reinhard Schramm, called the shock result “a confirmation of our worst fears”. Thomas Kemmerich of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) was able to unseat the leftist incumbent with the help of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose leader in the central state was accused in the past of using Nazi rhetoric. Meanwhile, the spokesman of FDP said Kemmerich had attempted to reach out to Schramm following the vote but without success. According to the Executive Vice President of the Berlin-based International Auschwitz Committee, Christoph Heubner, shortly after the Thuringia debacle, one recalls which Nazi grandees of the young federal republic found their political home in the FDP.
