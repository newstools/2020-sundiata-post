According to a report by The PUNCH, the Ogun State government on Friday disclosed that the victim of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Lagos had earlier visited Ogun state. The government said the victim whose name was not given fell ill after he visited Ogun State for a business trip from Italy. The Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Tomi Coker disclosed this during a press briefing held in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. The Ministry of Health in Lagos State had confirmed its first case of the disease (COVID-19), which incidentally was the first in Nigeria and in West Africa since the outbreak in China in January 2020. The commissioner said, “In the last 12 hours, the first case of the chronic virus has been identified in Nigeria and the individual was visiting Ogun State. “The individual is of Italian origin and he is a consultant to the Lafarge, Ewekoro factory.” She explained further that the victim entered Nigeria on Monday, February 24, about 9pm and visited Ogun State. According to her, before arriving in the state, he had made contacts with three people in the night in Lagos State and arrived on Tuesday morning in Ogun State. She added, “He stayed at a guest house and about 4pm on Wednesday, February 26, he developed a fever. “The hospital of Lafarge was very sensitive to the case, they responded immediately and contacted Lagos that they had a high suspicion.” The commissioner, however, allayed the fears of the people of the state of the disease, saying every necessary step that needed to be taken had been taken to avert the spread of the disease. He said, “However, my colleague, commissioner for health in Lagos, contacted me very early this morning to tell me the situation of things. “The Epidemiologists in the state being supported by federal and Lagos are trying to get every contact the patient had. “It means we are going to phone them, get them, get in touch with them and monitor their temperature for two weeks.” Details shortly…
