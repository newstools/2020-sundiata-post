Moscow – The Kremlin on Friday dismissed a reported claim that Russia had been attempting to interfere in the U.S. electoral process to get President Donald Trump re-elected this year. According to comments carried by state news agency TASS, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman described the claim as paranoid. “It was another in a series of paranoid reports. “We regret to say that their number will grow as the election approaches. They certainly have nothing to do with the truth,’’ spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The U.S. intelligence community has already concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to boost Trump, which led to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Trump has described the investigation as a “witch hunt.” On Thursday, U.S. media reported that U.S. intelligence officials had briefed lawmakers on Russian attempts to boost Trump’s 2020 re-election bid. According to multiple media reports citing unnamed sources, Trump expressed anger that Democrats were included in the briefing, claiming that the intelligence will be used by his rivals to attack him. While Trump has taken a softer rhetorical line on Russia versus his predecessors, he has sanctioned Moscow over its actions in Ukraine and expelled Russian officials in 2018. (dpa/NAN)
