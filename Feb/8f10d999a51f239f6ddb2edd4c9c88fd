Iheme Faith Uloma, the former Big Brother Naija housemate who is more popularly known as Ifu Ennada, took to her Instagram page to lament the hike in the price of face mask in Nigeria due to the confirmation of the deadly Coronavirus in Lagos. In the video shared by the reality TV star, a pharmacist could be heard saying the new price. Ifeanyi Ennada captioned the video; “Disposable face masks now 15,000 Naira! No longer 750naira or 10,000 naira which was the latest price in Lekki this morning like I reported some mins ago. This video was sent to me by one of my sisters who’s on the mainland. “Nigerians, we are our own problem. I hope these Pharmacies ripping people off their money also educate them on how to use and also inform them that only those who already have the Virus need to wear these face masks.” What the video shared by Ifu Ennada: Disposable face mask now 15,000 naira!
