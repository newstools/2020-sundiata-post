The first US patient to have been infected with the novel coronavirus survived and was released from hospital on Monday but remains in isolation, according to an Associated Press report.  The man had returned from a trip to Wuhan, China on January 15 and was hospitalized five days later, after blood tests confirmed he had the virus. He is one of 11 confirmed US patients to have been infected, while US health authorities monitor another 82 suspected cases. The 35-year-old man is looking forward to getting back to “normal life,” he said in a statement to the AP. His release from hospital comes after the Chinese government accused the USA of “spreading fear” over the virus, which has killed 426 people and infected at least 20,000 worldwide.
