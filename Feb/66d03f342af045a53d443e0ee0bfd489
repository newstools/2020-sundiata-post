By Diana Omueza/Angela Atabo Abuja – The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) says a strong ideological political party system is needed to curb defection and bring the practice to barest minimum. Mr Niyi Akinsiju, Chairman of the organisation said this while fielding questions at News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum on Monday in Abuja. Akinsiju noted that where politicians were bound by strong ideology, there would be reduction in defection by self-seeking politicians even in the face of intra-party crisis. According to him, reconciliation is the difference the BMO is looking out for in Nigeria, where political parties will actually reconcile during crisis and uphold their ideologies and foundation. “If one belonged to a party and its ideology, where there is an intra-party conflict, they must resolve it within and not dump the ship because there is an available party elsewhere. “Those who easily defect must be asked a question, what is the similarity in belief and ideology in the political party they are going into,’’ he said. Akinsiju said that the association supported the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ideology which led to its landslide victory in the 2019 general elections. He, however, said that the BMO could not physically intervene in the current crisis rocking the party. According to him, it is unofficially engaging with characters involved in the party. “Although BMO’s primary aim was to support President Muhammadu Buhari because of his philosophy, we are now a part of the APC and whatever concerns it concerns us. “With the setting up of the National Reconciliation Committee, the party’s crisis would be resolved. “This is the reason we cannot give up on the party against belief arising from the crisis at the state levels. “We hope and believe that the committee would move round to talk with party members and resolve whatever issues and, over time, the APC brand would actually evolve into a truly progressive brand,” he said.
