 MINNA – A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Niger State and former Commissioner for Information and Culture, Mr. Jonathan Vatsa has lambasted the National Chairman of the APC Comrade Adams Oshiomhole for condemning both the Supreme Court and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the disqualification of the Bayelsa State governor-elect, David Lyon. The former Publicity Secretary of the party in Niger State, who was reacting to comments by the National Chairman of the party, Oshiomole on Sunday while speaking to journalists in Minna, said: “The party leadership should look inward and ask themselves some fundamental questions rather than engaging in dictatorial comments which is capable of causing breakdown of law and order in the country.” The former commissioner also exonerated both the Supreme Court and INEC of any blame over the outcome of the Bayelsa governorship debacle, saying: “Oshiomole and the APC should blame themselves for the nullification of Lyon’s mandate by the court. “APC is the architect of its present predicaments if the truth must be told and the consequences must be damned. You can only reap what you sowed. “I strongly think that the party leadership should tell us who were the people that screened the deputy governor elect, Biobarakuma Degi-Eriemienyo to contest the election in the first place. Which papers did he present to the screening committee before he was cleared. “Or didn’t he undergo screening before contesting the party’s primary election? The national leadership of the party owe us some explanations. “Until the national leadership of our party led by Oshiomhole answers these questions, the national chairman should stop chasing shadows. You can’t plant yam and want to harvest cassava, It’s not possible. “If Oshiomhole is struggling to keep his job as the National Chairman of the party despite the huge crisis that have bedeviled us under him, there are better ways to go about it.” (New Telegraph)
