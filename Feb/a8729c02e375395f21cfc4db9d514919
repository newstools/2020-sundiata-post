Mogadishu – Somalia has called on Kenya to stop what it described as Nairobi’s interfering with its internal affairs and encroachment along the common border. “Kenya’s intrusion in the border areas outrightly undermines the stability and sovereignty of the Republic of Somalia,” the ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation said in a statement issued on Thursday. Somalia said it supports all operations authorised and led by the AU Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), but will not tolerate intrusion or encroachment of its sovereignty by any state. “At no given time will we tolerate any country that is part of the troop-contributing countries to the AMISOM to overstep its mandate and abuse its membership. “And also interference in the internal affairs of the host country with total disregard of the stipulated regulations of the government of Somalia,” the statement said. “The federal government of Somalia has unsuccessfully waited for the government of Kenya to protect against all actions that pose a threat to the historical relations between the two countries. “And also the long-standing economic, security and political cooperation between the two governments and citizens,” it said.
