Singapore – The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said that it is narrowing the issues needed before it can conduct a certification test flight on the grounded Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX. FAA top official Steve Dickson disclosed this to newsmen during a visit to the Singapore Airshow. “We are following a very diligent process and it is important that we stay focused on the process and not on the timeline,” he said. According to Dickson, the FAA is yet to fix a timetable for lifting a flight ban. He said that the administration was approaching a milestone. “The certification flight is the next major milestone and once that is completed I think we will have a good bit more clarity on where the process goes forward from there. “The certification flight to be carried out by FAA pilots is not scheduled yet because we still have a few issues to resolve, but we continue to narrow the issues. “We are waiting for proposals from Boeing on a few items,” he added. The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 following two fatal crashes in the space of five months. Boeing has adjusted cockpit software which has been blamed in part for overwhelming pilots and dropped objections to simulator training for pilots. Dickson said he expected close technical alignment between global regulators over the criteria for reversing the grounding. He said that when the time for that decision came there could be differences in how the jet “is put back to service worldwide”. (Reuters/NAN)
