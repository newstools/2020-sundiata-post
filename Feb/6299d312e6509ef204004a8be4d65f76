Moscow – The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that it would continue to allow Chinese citizens to enter the country if they have an official, business, humanitarian or transit visa, . Other Chinese citizens with a private, work, study or tourist visa will be banned from entering Russia as of Thursday to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the Foreign Ministry said. The epicentre of the outbreak is the city of Wuhan in central China. “The Russian side is supporting efforts by Chinese partners to counter the epidemic,’’ the statement said, describing the entry ban as temporary. No potential end date has been reported. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that commercial air traffic would continue between Moscow and the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The only two reported cases of the new coronavirus on Russian territory have been two Chinese nationals in Siberia who, according to Russian health officials, have fully recovered. (dpa/NAN)
