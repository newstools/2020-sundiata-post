Those who kill people go free but government will go after those who say they are not treated fairly and wants to discuss on ways of co-existence and declare them terrorists and ban them. Saying there is no justice in Nigeria today. He stressed that the state instead, is the one giving succour or motivation to these actors. Adding that there is no justice In the country.
