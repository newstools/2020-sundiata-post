According to The Nation, an indigene of Plateau State and staunch supporter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Murtala Anas Jos, has trekked from Calabar, Cross River State to Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital to celebrate the victory of Governor Douye Diri at the Supreme Court. Jos, who arrived Yenagoa on Wednesday, said it took him eight days to complete the journey, adding that he undertook the task to mark the victory of his party and Governor Diri. He said having followed the political trajectory of Diri, he was happy that the senator against all odds later emerged as an incumbent governor of Bayelsa. Jos claimed that the PDP remained the only party that understood the problems of the country and knew how to address the yearnings and aspirations of the people. He said: “I came from Calabar to Bayelsa State. It took me like eight days trekking to reach Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. “I decided to do this because of the love I have for my party, the PDP and to celebrate with Senator Douye Diri over his victory at the Supreme Court and subsequent swearing-in as the Bayelsa State governor. “This act is to show how I love and cherish my party, PDP, and to encourage the distinguished gentleman, who has come to work for prosperity, growth and development of Bayelsa State. “I hace never had any interaction with the governor not discussed with himbbut I’ve been following him since his days in the House of Representatives and Senate, and I know he is the type of leader Bayelsa needs at this moment. “Though, some hoodlums attacked me between Akwa Ibom and Rivers, they snatched my phones but I was not discouraged, because I was eager to celebrate my party’s victory in Bayelsa State”.
