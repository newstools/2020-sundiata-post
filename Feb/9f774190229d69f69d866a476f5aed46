By Ayinde Olaide Bauchi – Alhaji Abubakar Jarma, Director overseeing office of the Director General of Bauchi State Environmental Protection Agency (BASEPA), says the agency has reconstituted its Committee on Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). Jarma, in a statement by the agency’s Information Officer, Mr Dahiru Adamu, on Friday in Bauchi, said the committee was reconstituted to improve the agency’s IGR mechanism. He said this would also help the agency to meet up with the target given to it this financial year by the state government. Jarma called on members of the committee to be upright, honest, objective in their revenue drive and justify the confidence reposed in them by the management. He said the committee was expected to submit progress reports monthly. He said the committee members include: Abubakar Saleh, the Chief Accountant of the agency as the chairman, Daji Gombema, Mustapha Ahmad, Halliru Garba, Kabiru Isa. Others are Abdulkadir Sani and Bala Magaji, who would serve as Secretary of the committee. Jarma also directed Area Managers of the agency to adopt stringent measures to tackle the menace of felling of trees for Charcoal making and collection of sand by tipper drivers in their areas. He said the measures became imperative to avert the collateral damage of environmental degradation as a result of indiscriminate tree felling in forest reserves for charcoal making. He urged the Area Managers to collaborate with community leaders to sensitise the youth on the dangers of deforestation and work toward protection and conservation of the environment. (NAN)
