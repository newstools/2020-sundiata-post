Anthony Joshua, the wtorld boxing champion is enjoying his stay in Nigeria, with a visit Thursday night to the Afrika Shrine in Ikeja Lagos, where he was hosted by the high priest, Femi Kuti. Joshua was a humble champion all over again, as he prostrated to Femi, in the typical Yoruba tradition of greeting elders. Femi Kuti, successor to Fela Anikulapo Kuti’s afrobeats, is 57 years-old, while Joshua is 30 years old. Joshua also presented his four belts to Femi, with the singer unexpectedly wearing one of the belts on his neck.
