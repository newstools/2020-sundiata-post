A tanker carrying petrol has exploded along Owerri-Aba express road, killing one person and leaving many others critically injured. According to Vanguard, the tragic incident which happened on Thursday at about 11:15 was not too far from the Imo/Anambra River basin authority. It was gathered that the incident happened after the tanker laden with fuel collided with the road demarcation which sparked off the fire on the tanker. An eyewitness who spoke on account of anonymity said that one person lost his life and two others were badly wounded. At the time of filing this report, the men of the fire service station had mobilized their men to extinguish the fire. Speaking to Vanguard, the Director of Fire Service in Imo state, Japhate Okereafor, said among other things that “When I was informed of the incident I informed all my men and they turned out immediately and we started dispatching to the scene of a fire incident. “I even called the airport fire service, I called the control room and they gave me a sharp and fast response.” When asked if there was any casualty, he said: “It is one that died the other two escaped. I suspect the one that died should be the driver.” Source
