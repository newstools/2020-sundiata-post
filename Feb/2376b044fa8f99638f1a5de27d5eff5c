Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, has reacted to his father, Pete Edochie’s recent statement about men kneeling to propose to their women. Pete was spotted in a controversial video, criticizing men who get on their knees to propose to their partners. According to the actor, the act is not part of African culture and it confers authority on the wife as the head of the house, instead of the husband. Yul Edochie stumbled on a meme showing his father supposedly behind a man slightly bent and he decided to share it via Instagram. The meme read: “When you are about to kneel down to propose and you see Pete Edochie behind you.” The actor seemed amazed that his father’s remark snowballed into cheers and jeers on the internet.
