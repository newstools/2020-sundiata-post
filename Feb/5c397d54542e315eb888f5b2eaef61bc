By Tomisin Erogbogbo  Lagos – A Marriage Counsellor, Mr Saheed Lawal, has advised married couples to use Valentine’s Day outings and exchange of gifts as means of resolving disputes and mending cracks in the marriages. Saheed gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos. He said that exchange of gifts between couples during the celebration of love such as Valentine’s Day would strengthen love and communication between them. “I implore husbands to take their wives out and vice versa; it is a good opportunity to mend little cracks in their marriages that might transform into big dispute tomorrow. “Going out to a serene atmosphere to unwind also affords the couples the opportunity to communicate better, air out and solve issues of dispute. “The best time to get anything from anyone is when they are happy; if there is any misunderstanding between the couples, they can use the opportunity to settle it and make up. “It takes two to tango; husband buys gifts for wife and the wife should do same, try to spice up your marriage with acts of kindness toward each other,” he said. He advised couples to be considerate of each other and accommodate each other’s flaws in order to reduce the high rate of divorce in the society. NAN)
