A diehard supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari has asked for forgiveness from Nigerians after labeling the president a failure. Sadiq Suleiman who also had campaigned for Buhari’s second tenure said he was blinded by love for the president which didn’t let him see the failure his administration had recorded in the over 4 years he has been in power. Expressing his anger on Twitter, he wrote: “When I was madly in love with President Buhari. May Allah forgive me for the blind love I used to have for this failure. 
@atiku We hope you forgive us, we have learnt our lesson from Mr fake.” See his post below: When I was madly in love with President Buhari.
