Robert Burale, a popular Kenyan City pastor and motivational speaker, has spoken out against infidelity in relationships. During his recent appearance on ‘Mancave Discussion’ on Switch TV, the pastor noted that women are their own worst enemies, and added that if their spouses are unfaithful they should suspect their closest friends. “I blame both men and women because the man is cheating with another woman. Women have become their own worst enemies. Chances are very high that if your man is cheating on you look at your four closest friends. “I’ll tell you that without fear of contradiction or batting an eyelid. The person who is the most dangerous is the one you trust. It is the one you run to and say these are the issues I’m going through. She is the one who befriends you to cover up what she is doing with your husband. Not always but in most cases yes,” He also addressed emotional cheating after a woman complained that her husband doesn’t open up to her. “Emotional cheating is one of the most powerful things. Let me tell every woman today, when your man finds comfort in another woman even if they haven’t slept together, that’s so powerful. Negatively so.” “For someone to say he loves and respects me that’s why he keeps it away from me, the fact that a man cheats on you shows he does not love and respect you. It comes a time when you have to put your foot down. “In this day and age there are diseases and the worst thing is you walking with your husband or wife and the people who are sleeping with you are there saying you look good together. Protect your home because the moment you introduce two or three people that becomes a coalition government,” Burale added. Source
