Istanbul – Turkish President Recep Erdogan, on Wednesday, said Syrian government forces must withdraw from Turkish observation posts in the north-western province of Idlib by the end of February. Otherwise, Erdogan said Turkey would force them out. “If the regime does not withdraw in this period, Turkey will be forced to carry out this work itself,’’ Erdogan told his party members in parliament. Turkey has 12 military observation posts in Idlib, as part of a de-escalation agreement with Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Erdogan said two of these posts are now behind the Syrian government forces, which have been making gains in the rebel stronghold. The warning comes two days after eight Turkish military personnel were killed in Syrian shelling in Idlib. “Any attack from air or land against our soldiers will be retaliated against in kind, without looking at the source of the attack and without making any warning.’’ The Turkish president further threatened new military operations and also expanding the area of Turkey’s October incursion. “Turkish Armed Forces’ air and land units will be moving freely in all our operation areas and in Idlib anytime we need them; they will carry out operations when needed,’’ he said. This week’s attack is a “turning point” for Turkey in Syria, Erdogan charged in his fiery address. “Since the security of our soldiers in Idlib cannot be ensured, then nobody can object to us using our right to do this ourselves.’’ (dpa/NAN)
