Phnom Penhb – Nearly 800 passengers remaining in Cambodia, after their docked cruise ship had been turned away by five other nations over coronavirus fears, have tested negative to the virus, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday. Spokeswoman Or Vandine said the ministry was waiting on additional lab results for other passengers, but did not say how many tests were pending. The 781 passengers, some on the ship and others staying in a Phnom Penh hotel, who tested negative for Covid-19, did not have health-related problems at all, she said. One U.S. cruise passenger of the more than 2,000 people, who had been aboard Holland America Line’s Westerdam, tested positive for the virus in Malaysia after having disembarked the ship. The cruise line said on Monday that 255 guests and 747 crew were awaiting medical clearance on board. (dpa/NAN)
