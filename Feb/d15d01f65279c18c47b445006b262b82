By Moronke Boboye  Ikeja – An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Thursday sentenced two unemployed men to two months in Kirikiri Correctional Centre for stealing five bags of sugar valued at N50,000. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs S.K Matepo, jailed the two defendants following their pleas of guilty to the offences. Matepo sentenced them without an option of fine, saying that will serve as deterrent to others. The defendants Emeka Michael, 22 and Jerry Andrew, 30, both reside at Ikeja, were tried for conspiracy and stealing to which they pleaded guilty. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Innocent Odugbo told the court that the offences were committed on Dec. 18, 2019 at Oba Akinjobi Street, Ikeja. Odugbo said that the defendants stole five bags of Dangote sugar valued at N50, 000 from the truck. The prosecutor said the truck that was loaded of sugar was parked beside the road. “The defendants were arrested by the police on patrol,” he said. The offences contravened Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. (NAN)
