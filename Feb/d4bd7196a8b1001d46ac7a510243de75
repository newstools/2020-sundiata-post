By Fatima Mohammed-Lawal  Ilorin – The Kwara Government has urged the state-owned tertiary institutions to collaborate and harness available resources for development purposes. Hajia Sa’adatu Kawu, the state Commissioner for Tertiary Education, Science and Technology, gave the task on Friday during a visit to Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete, and International Aviation College in Ilorin. The commissioner noted that it was only through cooperation and support that the institutions could attain greatness to compete favourably with other institutions across the country. She said the state government would do everything possible within limited funds to address the enormous challenges facing its tertiary institutions. Earlier, the Acting Vice Chancellor of KWASU, Prof. Saka Mahmud, appealed to the state government to restore the institution’s monthly subvention to enable it meet up with some of its assignments. Mahmud, however, commended state government for its open policy and cordial relationship with state-owned institutions. He also appealed to the government to rehabilitate the road leading to the university from Ilorin through Shao. Mahmud added that the road networks within the institution’s campus needed attention to facilitate smooth vehicular movement. Also speaking, Mr Benedict Adeyelika, the Rector, International Aviation College, urged the state government to lift the ban on employment to enable the college engage more teaching staff and instructors.
