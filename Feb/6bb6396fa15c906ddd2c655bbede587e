Tel Aviv – Israeli aircrafts, on Monday struck targets in the Southern Gaza Strip, in response to a projectile launched from the coastal enclave. Israeli Military claims that it hit a training compound of the Islamist Hamas movement, which is in control of the Gaza Strip, as well as “military infrastructures. Hamas and Israel have been engaged in an informal truce brokered by Egypt, but since U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his controversial Middle East plan on January, Gaza militants have been launching rockets across Israelis border. Palestinians are furious over the Trump plan, which will give Israel the U.S. green light to extend its sovereignty over 30 per cent of the occupied West Bank in the near future, including all settlements and the Jordan Valley. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday threatened devastating action against organizations in Gaza. The Palestinian liaison office at the crossing point said a high-ranking Egyptian security intelligence delegation arrived in the Gaza Strip on Sunday through the Erez crossing point. The Egyptian delegation is scheduled to meet Hamas leaders, in a bid to avoid another large-scale armed confrontation. However, Israel has said it would not shy away from an offensive if necessary, even before a March 2, parliamentary election. In a bid to stop the ongoing rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip, Israel launched a large-scale incursion in July 2014 that lasted seven weeks and left more than 2,000 Palestinians dead.
