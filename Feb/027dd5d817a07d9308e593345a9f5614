A bizarre story stumbled on by OccupyGh.com indicates that a young man from Orlando, Florida had been charged with over 10 counts of rape for impersonating his father to sleep with his unsuspecting stepmother. Rob Johnson a 24-year-old man confessed he had been sleeping with Tiffiny Rhodes-Johnson 35 for over a year by pretending to be his drunk father. Rob would put on his father’s dirty close and rinse his mouth with alcohol and stumble onto his stepmother’s bed and made love to her. In his own confession, he said he usually wait for his dad to come home. His father usually come home after midnight during the weekend and he wouldn’t even try to go upstairs, he would sleep on the couch and that’s when Rob says he would take off his jacket or t-shirt and head upstairs to take his place in the main bedroom. Tiffiny said she did not suspect a thing because Rob was also coping with his father’s hairstyle and the way he grows his beard. She also said she never switched on the lights because if she does it would take her a long time to fall asleep again. “My husband always wakes up early whether he slept drunk or not so I never knew he had been sleeping on the couch on weekends” “I caught him because he shaved his pubes and my husband didn’t. I asked him why did he shave and he told me he thought I would like it and that was until the next day when my actual husband slept with me he had pubes.”
