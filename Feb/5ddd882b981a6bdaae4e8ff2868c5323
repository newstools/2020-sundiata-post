A former Big Brother Naija contestant, Nina Ivy, shocked many of her followers when photos and videos of a private traditional wedding between her and a yet-to-be-identified man went viral on the Internet. In an interview with Sunday Scoop, the fashion entrepreneur insisted that she would not reveal the identity of her hubby especially because the man is an extremely private person himself. She said, “I didn’t know that I would get married early; it just happened. I think it was God’s perfect timing. My hubby is extremely private and we are fine the way it is. “When the time for my white wedding comes, family and close friends would definitely be notified. I’m not yet sure how I want it.” The fair-skinned social media personality also waved aside claims that the marriage was a publicity stunt and that she was hiding her hubby’s identity for fear of losing him. She said, “Only a man that wants to be snatched will be. Trust me, we are very good. On if it’s a stunt, let’s wait and see. For now, everything is private. “Like I always say, speak your truth, know your truth and stand for the truth. That has been my motto lately and though it might not sit well with some people, I’m sure the world will adjust. One should just do one. “Pray and live your life because your happiness comes first. You have to be happy to share happiness with someone else.” Nina also stated that her stint at BBNaija had helped to grow her business. She said, “We get over 20 to 30 orders daily. This success could have only been with the support of my adorable fans that the Big Brother Naija platform gave me and I am thankful to God for that.” Source
