FG cluster heads and its monitoring teams on NSIP throughout the federation have threatened to sack more volunteers who are earning but are not going to tneir places of primary assignments. Recent developments have it that thirty volunteers from Adamawa state were evicted from the program due to absenteeism from their places of primary assignments. In the same vein,FG monitoring were in River state and had a brief meeting with Npower Volunteers at st Andrew state School at mile one within port harcourt metropolis on Friday 31 January 2020. The outcome of the meeting was to admonish volunteers to take their work seriously and keep working hard.That FG has good plans for them especially Batch A who are done with theirs and are waiting for exit package.Volunteers were seriously warned not to abandon their place of primary assignment, or such offender will automatically be sacked from the program. They reiterated that plans are ongoing to fish out those who are not working and as well to remove them from Government payroll. That all monitoring heads will as a matter of urgency intensify her oversight function in order to ensure that Volunteers are kept on their tolls. With this development,I will advise volunteers to wake up and be up and doing at their PPA to avert any form of sack from FG.Who knows FG might suddenly implement minimum wage bill on volunteers stipends and start paying close to N50,000 Naira. On the issue of volunteers stipend,your stipend will be paid soon,there is no cause for fowl cry.
