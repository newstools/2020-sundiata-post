By Ifeoma Aka  Enugu – Enugu State chapter of the Nigeria League of Women Voters, has urged women to be very active in politics to avoid marginalisation. The state chairperson of the league, Mrs. Nnenna Anozie made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Tuesday. Anozie said that the league, an Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) and a Civil Society Organisation(CSO) that aimed at empowering women both politically and economically. She said that the league encourages women to participate in election; adding that they discovered that in the last elections, many women did not participate either as voters or contestants in the elections. Anozie said that she uses the organisation to create more awareness to the girl child and to every woman to be aware of her civil rights in the state and the country at large. The chairperson said the group recently visited one of the girl’s school in Enugu where they shared sanitary pads, carried out sensitization awareness on dangers of drug abuse, rape and others. “This is one way of giving back to the society as well as empowering our women because knowledge is power. Most of them are not knowledgeable about their rights and how to keep hygiene. “Many of them are rape victims and they are not opening up because of stigmatization. “We want to embark on the sensitisation drive in all the states in the country; hoping that come 2023 most of our women will be equipped to run for political offices both at the local, state and national level,” she said.
