Residents of Jiddari Polo in Maiduguri, Borno state capital, are currently running for cover following an attack launched by Boko Haram fighters. The attack happened hours after President Muhammadu Buhari paid a condolence visit to the people of the state over the killing of 30 persons on Sunday. A resident told TheCable that the insurgents have been shooting sporadically for over 30 minutes. “We are under serious attack right now. Boko Haram stormed the town hours after the president left,” he said. Buhari had headed to Borno from Ethiopia where he attended the African Union summit. Speaking at the palace of Abubakar Elkanemi, the shehu of Borno, the president had said Boko Haram could not thrive without local support. “This Boko Haram or whatever they are, cannot come up to Maiduguri or environs without the local leadership knowing because traditionally the local leadership is in charge of security in their own respective areas. So with my understanding of our culture, I wonder how Boko Haram survives up till now,” he had said. More details later… TheCable
