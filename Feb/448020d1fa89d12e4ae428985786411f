In the motion on notice presented to the court, the activist is seeking enforcement of fundamental human rights of Maryam Booth as guaranteed under Sections 34, 35(1), 37, 38 and 46 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.

Maryam Booth alleged that Deezell had severally threatened to blackmail her by leaking her nude video if she didnâ€™t give him an undisclosed amount of money. Source
