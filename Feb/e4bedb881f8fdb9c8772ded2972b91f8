The President’s condolence message was conveyed in a statement by Mr Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, in Abuja on Thursday. The President joined professional and political associates of the former presidential aide in mourning the departed, who served the country in many capacities, including Special Adviser to President Shehu Shagari.
