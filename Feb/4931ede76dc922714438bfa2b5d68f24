Armed bandits numbering over 60 riding on motorcycles have invaded Madaka and neighbouring communities in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State. The men of the underworld it was learnt attacked the communities at about 6.a.m Wednesday shooting sporadically, thereby causing pandemonium. A source from the area told New Telegraph that not less than 100 cows were rustled and countless number of villagers kidnapped in the operation. According to the source, “those kidnapped by the bandits were being used as shields in their escape efforts. “As they were shooting, they (bandits) are heading towards Allawa in Shiroro Local Government Area. “We cannot say if there are any casualties or death until after the situation has returned to normal.” He, however, confirmed to our Correspondent that: “The Nigerian Air Force were swift in attending to our distress calls because right now, we can see their helicopters hovering in the air to get the bandits.” Efforts to get the Chairman of Rafi Local Government, Alhaji Ismaila Isa Modibo, for his comments was abortive as his cell phone was switched off.
