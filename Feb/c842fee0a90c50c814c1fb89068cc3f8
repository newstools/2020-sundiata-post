By Moronke Boboye  Ikeja – A 49-year-old car dealer, Sobur Adeyanju, who allegedly obtained N2.3 million under false pretences, was on Thursday brought before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court. Adeyanju, who resides at No. 8, Ijaola St., Onigbongbo, Maryland, Lagos, is being tried for obtaining money under false pretences, stealing and causing breach of peace. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, W/Sgt. Chekube Okeh, told the court that the offences were committed sometime in August 2016 at Ikeja. Okeh said that the complainant, Mr Khaleed Agbomabiwon, gave the defendant N2.3 million to help him purchase a Toyota Corolla car, 2008 model. The prosecutor also alleged that the defendant, however, failed to purchase the car and he did not return the money to the complainant. Okeh said since the defendant collected the money, he has been avoiding the complainant. The offences contravened Sections 168, 287 and 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs A.O. Akinde, granted the defendant N500,000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Akinde, however, adjourned the case until March 10, for mention. (NAN)
