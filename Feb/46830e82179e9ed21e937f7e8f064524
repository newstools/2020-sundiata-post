Beijing – China Tourist Attractions Association, together with 51 tourist attractions across China, has issued a convention on strengthening epidemic prevention measures at tourist sites to provide visitors a safe environment, and in reply to the country’s call to resume work and business. The convention, based on epidemic prevention-related policies of the National Health Commission and guides on work resumption in tourism spots, proposes a total of nine suggestions and operating standards concerning issues such as disinfection of equipment, health management of working staff, time-sharing control on visitor flow and online information disclosure of epidemic prevention. In tourist sites with high personnel density, big data techniques will be introduced to help to divide reservations into different periods. In the meantime, ticket booking will be transferred to online platforms to avoid face-to-face contact and the gathering of people at the scene for purchasing tickets, according to the convention. It also enables tourists to have access to information about the epidemic prevention of tourism sites via mobile apps. The convention will give guidance to tourist sites on epidemic prevention and control after their opening, as well as give impetus to the recovery of cultural and tourism-related industries, said Zeng Bowei, an official with the China Tourism Association. The first batch of 51 involved tourist attractions include 33 sites with China’s highest 5A rating, such as Pingyao Ancient City. (Xinhua/NAN)
