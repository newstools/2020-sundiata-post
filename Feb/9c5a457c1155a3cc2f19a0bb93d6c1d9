Brussels – The EU is suspending its remaining sanctions against four Zimbabwean individuals, including long-time president Robert Mugabe who died in 2019, while renewing an arms embargo and an asset freeze on one firm, Zimbabwe Defence Industries. “The decision has been taken in light of developments in Zimbabwe, including the yet to be investigated alleged role of the armed and security forces in human rights abuses,’’ EU foreign ministers said in a statement issued on Monday. The measures would come into effect when they are published in the bloc’s Official Journal on Tuesday. The EU imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe in 2002, following a government crackdown on the opposition and the eviction of white farmers from agricultural land. In recent years, the sanctions list was whittled down to a handful of individuals, including Mugabe and his wife Grace. In October 2019, Zimbabwe held a public holiday to protest against EU and U.S. sanctions that remained in place after Mugabe’s death the previous month. Monday’s EU statement also highlighted Zimbabwe’s “acute humanitarian crisis” and called upon the government to press ahead with reforms, tackle corruption and open up the country’s democratic space to help address the crisis, which includes a severe food emergency. The 27-country EU is supporting Zimbabwe with development aid. (dpa/NAN)
