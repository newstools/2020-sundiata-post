By Babatunde Ogunrinde  Lagos – An author, Mrs Omobola Imoisili, on Wednesday said that her book titled ‘Feyi Fay’ would go a long way to inspire Nigerian and African kids from ages 6-10 to learn more about culture. Imoisili, who is based in the U.S, told newsmen in Lagos that the book was largely inspired by the Disney Comic series and had a Nigerian flavour. She said that the book would go a long way to teach kids not to run away from their problems such as bullies, but have the courage to face them. “This is my first attempt at writing books for kids, especially for age six and 10; the book is very entertaining and it has the capabilities to be turned into a television series,”Imoisili said. According to her, the book has gained a lot of acceptance in Los Angelis, U.S and she is looking at how to impact the Nigerian market. “I am in the country to see how it can be useful for kids in Nigeria and I plan to visit primary schools in Ilupeju and Ikeja. “I intend to launch the book in Nigeria with my other products like toys and bag packs and many other range of products I would be bringing soon,” she said. Imoisili, who is a Computer Science graduate in England, said that her passion to write was just to impact kids for now. She said the insipration behind the book was drawn from the fact that she wanted her two daughters to connect with Nigerian culture. According to her, she wants other kids around the world to learn and discover many things that can impact them positively and connect them to their roots. (NAN)
