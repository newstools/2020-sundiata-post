With over 25 countries reported cases of Coronavirus and the global toll of over 40,000 cases with at least over 909 fatalities, the APC Chairman in the Scandinavia countries, Ayoola Lawal, has called on the Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Hon. Osagie Ehanire to adopt technological collaboration with private sectors and institutions in its efforts against the virus. He said, “The world is in uncharted waters now, and real pro-active measures must be taken to prevent the importation of this deadly virus into the developing world especially the most populated black nation of the earth, Nigeria. “We must be prepared to use technology in monitoring, detecting, preventing and contain the deadly Coronavirus in an effective manner in case it is imported into Africa”. He further urged the Federal government to take a serious look in partnering with cybersecurity or mobile application companies or institutions to come up with mobile apps that can warn users when they are at imminent risk of contracting the novel coronavirus or check if they travelled by bus, plane or train with someone who caught the virus and how they can be tracked”. He said, “The Chinese government and some companies already unveiled such region adaptive apps and we can be very proactive learning from them because of our population and lack of resources to handle any such deadly virus outbreak.” While commending the efforts of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control for its diverse strategies in preventing the importation of Coronavirus into Nigeria, He urged them to further sustain the tempo through consistent public awareness and sensitization until the world comes up with the cure to the deadly virus and also, private sectors and NGO’s must be brought on board to curb this deadly disease.
