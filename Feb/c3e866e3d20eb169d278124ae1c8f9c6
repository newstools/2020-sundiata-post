Sis said she would just rather pay all her bills and not be bothered by him. Good for her Update: the straw that broke the camel’s back is they have a newborn & he was still insisting on her half of the bills. Anyways I’m not telling anymore of my cousin’s business y’all already accusing me of lying lmao. Y’all take it easy, I’m muting this 😘🖤”
