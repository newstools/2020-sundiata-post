Beijing – After a recent strained relationship between Beijing and Berlin, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, said on Wednesday that he would visit Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, disclosed this to Newsmen in Beijing. He said that Yi would also hold talks with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. According to him, Yi was originally supposed to meet Maas in Oct. 2019, but was, however, cancelled after Maas met Joshua Wong, a protest leader in Hong Kong, in September. Shuang noted that at that time, China summoned the German ambassador to Beijing and threatened negative consequences for bilateral relations. He added that Yi would also meet with other leading German politicians during his visit, as well as to discuss international cooperation over the new coronavirus outbreak at the security conference. However, about 40 leaders and 100 ministers will discuss global security policy at the annual gathering. (dpa/NAN) YI/YEE
