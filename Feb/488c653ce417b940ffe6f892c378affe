A Nigerian man identified as Ekerenam Asuquo has advised newly married couples not to spend their first night in hotels as men have slept on same beds with prostitutes. Taking to Facebook, he wrote; “Dear newly married couples… Stop going to hotels to spend your first night with each other… The same bed hired by some men to sleep with prostitutes is where you lay your marital alter… Its not just wrong, its stupid. Even if you have one room, sleep with your wife in your one room. Sex is spiritual. Don’t mess up your “foundation” (Over sabi people will now say I’m being religious… I’m being spiritual dear) ARE WE TOGETHER?” View Post Below: Source
