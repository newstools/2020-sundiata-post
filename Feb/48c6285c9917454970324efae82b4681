He, however did not disclose the name of the shooter. However, an eye witness said the shooter was a Development Centre Coordinator for one of the Development Centres in the council. The eyewitness, who spoke to on condition of anonymity for fear of victimisation, said there was a serious clash between two groups at the venue of the councillorship election at Uwanna where armed thugs shot sporadically into the air to scare voters but it took the intervention of the Police who stormed the area and stopped them. “There was a serious problem but the police came and teargassed them and the boys were disparsed. But later when the police left, the coordinator was said to have pulled out a gun and shot at his brother who is opposing his preferred candidate but fortunately he dodged the bullet and the bullet hit Ibiam who was standing at his back” she stated
