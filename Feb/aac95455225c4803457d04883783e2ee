Paris Diamond, a 19-year-old Mass Communication student of the Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education Owerri, Imo State, hawks satchet water every weekend, sells Jollof rice in school, among other petty tradings to make money. Taking to Facebook on Sunday, Mis Diamond shared photos of herself hawking satchet water and said that she prefers doing such jobs than sleeping with men for money. “I sell pure water to buy text books for myself in school and sometimes use it to pay bills I go to the market every Friday evening, Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon after church , i enjoy doing it since i do get money for one or two text books in 2 days. I prefer doing this than sleeping with men for money Yes I slay but guess what is pure water business. I sell almost 7 or 8 bags a day depending on the lucky day . I’m a mass communication student. Sometimes my friends will be like “babe this pure water business no fit u o” I smile and tell them I love it. I’m a Nigerian writer too, I have two novels and one drama I have published already but due to money issue I couldn’t make lots of copies. Sometimes when I come back I will tired to read but I try my best. I hustle pure water and sometimes sell jellof rice in school, I make hair, slippers and clothes with this my small but mighty business” Source
