Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has boasted that the funeral of his parents has brought the ‘divided’ people of Southeast and South South together again. Kanu’s parents, HRH Eze Israel Kanu and his wife, Ugoeze Sally Kanu, who died last year, were laid to rest on Friday in their royal compound in Afaraukwu community, Umuahia, the Abia State capital. The IPOB leader was conspiciously absent during his parents’ burial ceremony. Kanu was last seen in Nigeria on September 10, 2017 after some soldiers invaded his residence in Afaraukwu community in Abia State. The burial was well attended by politicians, traditional and religious leaders from the two neighbouring regions and beyond. Nnamdi Kanu tweeted, “I’m joyful my parent’s burial finally brought the artificially divided people of SE and SS together as one Biafran family. “Thank you Biafrans, friends and well-wishers for a truly memorable funeral.” Source
