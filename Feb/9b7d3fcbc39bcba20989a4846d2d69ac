By Abiodun Esan  Ilorin – The North Central Coordinator of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Isyaku Sharu, says it is disheartening to see Nigerian youths glorifying looters of public funds. Sharu said this on Thursday in Ilorin while speaking at a one-day multi-stakeholder security dialogue organised by the Kwara Government. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the theme of the dialogue was: “Towards strengthening the security architecture in Kwara State: Exploring community initiatives”. NAN also recalls that some youths gathered at the premises of the Federal High Court in Ilorin in solidarity with a former commissioner of finance, Mr Ademola Banu, facing charges of money laundry. “It is a shame to see youths mobilised to the court during the trial of an alleged looter of Kwara treasury recently at the Federal High Court, hailing the accused person. “We must stop glorifying these looters of public fund if we want to be secured. “Security and corruption are interwoven. For us to enjoy security, we must wage war against corruption. “I was even more surprised to see the accused person waving shamefully at the youths, who were hailing him. It is a national disgrace and a big shame,” Sharu said. The EFCC sonal coordinator described corruption as breeding ground for social injustice in Nigeria. He said that EFFC would on Feb. 14 organised an anti-corruption rally in collaboration with the National Youths Service Scheme (NYSC). The EFFC boss appealed to the people to always volunteer information to security agencies in the state on any suspicious person or movement. According to him, any information received from member of the public that led to recovery of public fund, the whistle blower would receive a stipend. (NAN)
