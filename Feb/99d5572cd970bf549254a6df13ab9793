By Stellamaris Ashinze Lagos – A Nigerian, Folasewa Olatunde, a Doctoral student at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, U.S., has been selected as the pioneer Fellow of the newly introduced Digital Rights and Inclusion Learning Lab (DRILL) by Paradigm Initiative (PI). Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director, Paradigm Initiative, made this known in Lagos on Wednesday. Sesan noted that Olatunde was passionate about how Nigerians across different age groups could continue to learn to use digital technologies to improve their socio-economic conditions. He said that the group was pleased about the selection due to the quality of application that was submitted. He said that the Fellowship would offer a space for big thinking, evaluation of digital rights and digital inclusion programmes and future-proofing of ecosystem activities. Sesan said there were enormous challenges and opportunities for realising the ambitious task of creating an inclusive, healthy, safe and open Internet in the coming decade for all Africans. According to him, DRILL is Paradigm Initiative’s project to host innovative learning around digital rights and inclusion in Africa. “The learning lab serves as a space for both practice and reflection, aimed to involve and connect different stakeholders and create dialogue among researchers, social innovators, policy makers and actors, the private sector, as well as civil societies. “Learning activities will take place at the lab in order to evolve new thinking on digital rights and inclusion strategy for Africa. “There are a variety of activities that will take place, including but not limited to focused future-facing research. “Presentations; ecosystem meetings and discussions focused on digital rights inclusion hosted within the ecosystem; and general communication about the lab’s activities,’’ he said. Meanwhile, the Digital Rights and Inclusion Media Fellowship, another Paradigm Initiative project, has attracted 116 applications from 19 countries. (NAN)
