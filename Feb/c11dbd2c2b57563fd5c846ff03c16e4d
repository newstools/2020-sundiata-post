By Amen Gajira  Kafanchan – The Executive Chairman of Jema’a Local Government Area (LGA), Mr Peter Averik, says his council remains committed to executing meaningful projects to meet the yearnings of the people, especially those living in the rural communities. Averik made this known on Friday during an interaction with the Kashim Ibrahim Fellows, who paid him a visit in continuation of their leadership capacity building tour to all the 23 LGAs of the state. The Chairman, who described Jema’a as the socio-economy and political melting point of southern Kaduna, said his council had achieved a lot in the areas of security, health, roads in spite of the financial challenges confronting it. He also described Gov. Nasir el-rufai, as a visionary leader worthy of emulation by young aspiring leaders, noting that he enjoyed working with the governor in spite of the differences in political affiliation. He advised the fellows to see themselves as future leaders and to make the best use of the rare opportunity of being with the governor by learning from his leadership style. Averik said keying into the leadership style of el-Rufai, prudent management of resources and selfless leadership were the secret of his council’s successes. Earlier, the administrator of Kashim Ibrahim Fellows, Miss Zainab Mohammed, said they had visited to tap from the knowledge and leadership experience of Averik as they seek to equip themselves for possible leadership roles in future. Mohammed said they were impressed with the council’s performance following the inspection of projects executed in the council, describing the projects as central to the people. (NAN)
