Nike has revealed the new 2020 kit collection for Nigeria on Wednesday. The new â€˜Swooshâ€™ design will replace the beloved Naija design. The Super Eagles teamed up with the sports manufacturer ahead of the 2018 World Cup to deliver the Naija collection which broke sales records ahead in the run-up to the tournament in Russia. However, the new designsâ€”published on the Nike News site on Wednesdayâ€”could even rival the Naija apparel. Nike have also explained how the â€˜Swooshâ€™ designs follow in the footsteps of the Naija collection, inspired by local fabric and infused with a â€˜traditional aestheticâ€™.
