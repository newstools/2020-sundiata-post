A video has emerged on social media showing some students of a secondary School in Katsina beating up a man said to be a teacher in their school. In the footage which has now gone viral and which was shared by Kastina Post Hausa, the students are seen beating an older man in a green jersey while their colleagues cheered them on. The teacher finally managed to extricate himself from their grasp and grabbed one of the students. “Are you mad?” the visibly angry teacher asked as he slapped the boy across the face.
