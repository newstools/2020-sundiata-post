Brussels – The parties to the Iran nuclear deal will meet in Vienna on Wednesday for the first time since Germany, France and Britain triggered a dispute mechanism in January in response to Iranian breaches of the accord. The EU Foreign Policy Chief, Josep Borrell, who oversees implementation of the nuclear deal, said the joint commission meeting was established to handle disputes. The talks will be attended by representatives of Iran, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, the remaining parties to the 2015 accord aimed at preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. The deal has been in jeopardy ever since the U.S. pulled out in 2018, re-imposing stringent economic sanctions that had been lifted in return for Tehran’s cooperation. Since then, Iran has scaled back its compliance with the deal, announcing in early January that it no longer felt bound by some of its key restraints. In response, the Europeans said they had no choice, but to trigger the dispute resolution mechanism, launching a multi-stage process that could ultimately lead to the collapse of the accord and the global re-imposition of sanctions. However, Britain, France and Germany said that their aim was to rescue the deal and not to sink it. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal, arguing that it does not go far enough in preventing Iran from developing a nuclear bomb and fails to address regional issues. However, the Europeans argued that the deal was working until that point and that concerns around issues such as Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its role in Syria, and other countries, should be dealt with separately.
