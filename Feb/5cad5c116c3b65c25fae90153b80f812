The Ekiti State Police Command have arrested three secondary school teachers for allegedly raping female pupils. The three suspects, who are currently cooling their legs at the command headquarters in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, were from Osi Grammar School, Osi Ekiti in Ido/Osi local government area and All Saints Grammar School in Ado Ekiti metropolis. While addressing journalists, the Command, Public Relations Officer, Mr. Sunday Abutu, said the suspects were alleged to have had sexual intercourse with the victims . Abutu said the teachers were reported to the police through a petition received from an activist ( names withheld) that the suspects allegedly molested the victims sexually . “The suspects, one from Osi Grammar school and two from All Soul’s Grammar School are in our custody and they are giving us useful information. “We have invited the victims and they are giving useful information to us, as well. “But as of now, the victim from Osi Grammar School declined the allegation while being interrogated . “But we are not resting, we will get to the root of the matter “, he said. Abutu said the victims from All Soul’s have been invited by the police for interrogation, saying they are yet to give information concerning the incident . The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Wale Fapohunda, had last week raised the alarm over incessant cases of alleged rape in many of the secondary schools across the state. Fapohunda said that all the cases already reported to the government and security agencies will be investigated and the culprits prosecuted, to serve as deterrent to others. The Nation
