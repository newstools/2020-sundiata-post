Joan Odafe  Lagos – The Nagari Nakowa Motorcycles Owners and Riders Association of Lagos (NNAMORAL) has cautioned residents of Amuwo-Odofin area against patronising unregistered motorcyclists. The association said during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos that the caution was to ensure the safety of lives and property of residents of the area. Femi Mathias, Amuwo Zone C Chairman of NNAMORAL, said it was mandatory for registered members of the association to wear yellow reflective vests with their registration numbers while on duty. He said that the association had adapted to the recent restriction of commercial motorcyclists and tricyclists on certain routes in Lagos and adopted new strategies to comply with the rules. Mathias said the association had a database for every registered member and a task force that ensured that they abide by the rules. According to him, the duty of the task force is to check the excesses of the motorcyclists by preventing them from harassing residents when accidents occurred. Mathias listed other duties of the task force to include preventing motorcyclists from going on restricted routes and aiding criminals as well as intercepting those who move around with dangerous weapons and those who take drugs. “Whenever our task force stop motorcyclists, they check if they are in possession of knives, screwdrivers or anything that can injure passengers. “There is a rider’s scan as well. We are also screening out the underaged motorcyclists from the system, even those who take drugs are also being screened out,” NAN.
