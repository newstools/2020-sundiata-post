The Supreme Court has laid to rest the hyped review of its February 13th judgement nullifying the governorship electoral victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State. The apex court affirmed its earlier judgement, dismissed the application for a review filed by the APC and its sacked Governor-elect, David Lyon, insisting that there must be an end to litigation. The final verdict of the highest court implied that Senator Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who had been sworn-in since February 14th as the governor of Bayelsa, would lead the state for the next four years. Immediately after the judgment, the immediate past Governor of the State, Seriake Dickson, the incumbent governor, Diri, the state Chairman, PDP, Cleopas Moses and other PDP stalwarts were seen singing worship songs in Dicksonâ€™s Abuja residence. Dickson led his loyalists and political godson, Diri, in most of the songs while Major Lance and Cleaopas concluded the emergency worship session in prayers. They all knelt down for over 20 minutes singing and praying to thank God for the final pronouncement of the court and the PDP victory, which they described as a miracle. The camp of the APC and its leaders were, however, left in shock at the decision of the Supreme Court to throw out its application for a review. The APC leaders wore long faces and their camp was quiet after the decision of the Supreme Court. The sacked Deputy Governor-elect, Degi Erimienyo, on whose account APC lost Bayelsa, was in court sitting close to the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole. However, PDP leaders were seen in wild jubilation, shouting and dancing to mark the end to the litigation, which caused tension in the state. The Nation
