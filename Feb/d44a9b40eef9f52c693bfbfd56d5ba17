The former Minister of Aviation and Culture, Femi Fani-Kayode has refuted the assertion made by the president, President Muhammadu Buhari that 90% of Boko Haram victims are Muslims. Recall that following the release of the video of the Killing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Chairman, Reverend Lawani Andimi by Boko Haram, the president earlier today released a press statement where he mourned once again the death of the clergyman. He went on to encourage Nigerians to stand strong and not to allow terrorists to divide the country. He also added that majority of those killed by the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) formerly known as Boko Haram are Muslim, not Christians. Disagreeing with this, the former spokesman to former president Olusegun Obasanjo, Femi Fani-Kayode has taken to his Twitter handle @realFFK to state his opinion that this statement was not entirely true. In his words: “90% of Boko Haram victims are Muslim”- Buhari This is a lie.The overwhelming majority of communities that BH targets are Christian.The same with the Fulani militias.The killing of Christians in Nigeria is a common blood sport which shall continue as long as Buhari is President.
