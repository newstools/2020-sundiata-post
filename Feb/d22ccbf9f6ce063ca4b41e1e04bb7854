By Ismaila Chafe  Abuja – President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris as he commemorates 45 years on the throne of his forefathers. The president, in a congratulatory message issued by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Tuesday, described the foremost traditional ruler as “a symbol of peace, stability, unity and development of his people.” According to him, the Emir “remains not only a shining light and custodian of the culture of the Emirate, but also a revered monarch whose wise counsel to governments at the state and federal levels over the decades, remain invaluable and enduring.” President Buhari urged the 18th Emir of Zazzau and Chairman of the Kaduna State Council of Traditional Rulers not to waver in his belief in the unity of his fatherland, but to do all within his power to ensure that his domain remains a model of peace. He prayed that almighty Allah would endow the longest-serving Emir of Zazzau with longer life and wisdom to enable him continue to serve his Emirate, society and humanity. (NAN)
