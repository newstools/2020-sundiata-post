Popular Nollywood actress, Stella Damasus, has given words of advice to her colleagues in the industry that posing nude will not make them sexy. In a post shared on her Instagram page, the 41-year-old said one can appear sexy by just wearing a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, being confident, among others. Sharing a beautiful photo of herself, the actress wrote: “I will say it again. You don’t have to be nude or vulgar in your appearance to be SEXY. The way you carry yourself even in A pair of Jeans and a sweatshirt can make heads turn. Your confidence can be SEXY. Your smile can be SEXY. Your voice can be SEXY. Even your eyes alone can make you SEXY. Don’t show it all or put everything out there to be called SEXY. You are enough dear.” See her post below: I will say it again.
