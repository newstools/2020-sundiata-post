Ramallah – A 17-year-old Palestinian boy was fatally shot during clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Hebron on Wednesday The boy becomes the first protester killed since the U.S. unveiled its plan for the Middle East. The Health Ministry in Ramallah announced the death. The Israeli army did not immediately have a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his Middle East plan last week, which he said would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The plan foresees Israeli control over the West Bank, Jordan Valley and key holy sites in Jerusalem. Palestinians have rejected the plan, fearing that it will recognise Israeli claims to parts of the West Bank, which they want for their future state. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the region is considered occupied territory by most of the international community. The plan has prompted sporadic protests throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the days after it’s unveiling. Demonstrations have so far not been as deadly as those that followed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018. (dpa/NAN)
