An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti, on Thursday, handed a 55-year-old man, Bashiru Adeyanju 14 years prison sentence. It was gathered that the man had attempted to rape of his daughter. Justice Monisola Abodunde sentenced the convict without an option of fine. The court, which found Adeyanju guilty of the offence based on his confessional statement and the accounts of witnesses called during the trial, however, discharged him of the offence of serial rape. The judge said the three years that the convict had already spent in prison during the trial should be subtracted from the jail term. The prosecution counsel, Mr Wale Fapohunda, had during the trial said that the convict committed the offences on September 10, 2017, at No. 30, Irona Street, Ado-Ekiti. Fapohunda, who is the stateâ€™s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, had said that Adeyanju on the said date, unlawfully attempted to have sexual intercourse with his 17-year-old daughter. He explained that Adeyanju, whose wife left him when the victim was 10 years old, confessed that he always beat the victim whenever she refused to have sexual intercourse with him. Source
