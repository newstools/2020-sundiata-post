By Ahmed Mohammed Kaigama Bauchi – Abubakar Sulaiman, Speaker, Bauchi State House Assembly, has called on wealthy individuals and corporate bodies to assist orphans and vulnerable children in the society. Sulaiman made the call at the distribution of clothing materials to Islamic school children by a Bauchi based NGO, Dangin Juna Africa Initiative, on Sunday in Bauchi. He said that such gesture was imperative to assist vulnerable children to integrate into the society and have a sense of belonging.

The speaker urged political leaders, wealthy individuals and development organisations to emulate the gesture and contribute towards building a better society.
