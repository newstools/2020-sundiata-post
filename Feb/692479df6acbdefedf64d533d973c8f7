A 70-year-old woman identified as Sidikat Jimoh, has been gruesomely murdered by some suspected ritualists, removing her vital organs in Ogbagi Akoko in Akoko North West Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was gathered that the woman killed this morning and found in a pool of her blood in her residence around Ayetoro area of the town in the early morning. According to an eyewitness, the assailants after removing the vital parts from the woman also tried to set her remains ablaze but had to leave in a hurry, leaving behind some of the vital organs removed from their victim. He described the late Septuagenarian as a peace-loving and religious and wondered what could be responsible for the killing as no property or money was removed from her home. He said: “This woman was full of life yesterday and even attended the weekly prayer meeting at the Ansar Ud Deen Society of Nigeria Central mosque, before returning home. “It is unfortunate that these hoodlums visited her home and killed her and removing her vital organs.” He, however, said the incident was reported to the police station while security operatives from the area removed her corpse to the State Specialist Hospital in Ikare Akoko. The Area Commander for Ikare Police Division, ACP Razak Rauf, who confirmed the incident, said policemen from the town swung into action and visited the scene of the incident. He said there was no arrest but disclosed that investigation had commenced into the killing, assuring that the killers would be brought to book. Source
