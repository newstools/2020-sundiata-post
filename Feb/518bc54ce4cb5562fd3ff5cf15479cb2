Kabul – U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Friday that the U.S. has reached an `understanding with the Taliban to significantly reduce violence in Afghanistan. According to the statement, if the move is successfully implemented, signing an agreement with the militants could move forward. Earlier, the U.S. defence secretary had said the reduction in violence would be for seven days. If successful, it would pave the way for an agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban that includes a timetable for a withdrawal of U.S. troops and guarantees the Taliban would not allow the country to become a safe haven for terrorists. According to the statement, the deal is to be signed on February 29. Talks between different Afghan groups would begin soon thereafter, Pompeo said, adding that those would build upon this “fundamental step to deliver a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.’’ The U.S. top diplomat, however, said the only way to achieve peace is for Afghans is “to come together and agree on a way forward.’’ The statement, in the meantime, did not provide any detail on when the understanding of reduction in violence would start, and how it would implement.
