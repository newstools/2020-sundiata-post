Rome  –  Pope Francis on Sunday called on worshippers to take care and to follow regulations to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus when taking part in religious services. Pope made the call in a statement on Sunday. “In some countries, liturgical celebrations with the faithful have begun again, while in others this step is under consideration. “Please, let us follow the guidelines we are given to protect the health of each individual, and of the people,” he said. In Italy, religious services may be celebrated as of Monday, but the public is called on to observe social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The pope is set to celebrate a Mass in St Peter’s Basilica on Monday in honour of John Paul II, whose 100th birthday would have fallen on May 18. However, this is to take place behind closed doors, attended only by a few priests. St Peter’s Square and St Peter’s Basilica have been closed since the outbreak of the pandemic at the beginning of March. (dpa/NAN)
