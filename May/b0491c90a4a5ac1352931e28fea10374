Nairobi  –  Without external help, Uganda’s foreign exchange reserves will fall to under two months of import cover in 2020/21 and leave the country in a vulnerable position, the International Monetary Fund said in a statement issued on Friday. “Absent external support, the expected deterioration in the current, capital and financial accounts would result in a sharp decline of the Bank of Uganda’s (BoU) reserve buffer,” the IMF said. “This would be below the adequate level of reserves for Uganda, and would leave the country in a vulnerable position,” it added.
