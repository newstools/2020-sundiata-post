Harare  –  The Police in Zimbabwe will arrest anyone leaving their homes without wearing face masks starting from Monday, Deputy Minister of Information, Energy Mutodi, said on Sunday. “With effect from tomorrow, Monday, May 4, the Police will arrest anyone seen without putting on a mask in the CBD, entering shops or any public places,’’ Mutodi announced on twitter. The development follows President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s announcement on Friday that members of the public will be required to wear face masks in all public spaces. Mnangagwa also extended the lockdown, which was meant to end on Sunday, by two weeks but downgraded it to stage-2, allowing some industries to resume operations.
