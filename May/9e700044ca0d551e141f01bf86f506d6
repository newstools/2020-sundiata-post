Almost all companies in the state are no longer in operation due to lockdown. “Also other areas where the state gets revenue are no longer operational. This also is another reason for giving political office holders half salary. “Those affected at the local government level are the chairmen, vice-chairmen, elected councillors, supervisory councillors, advisers and secretaries of local governments.” Source
