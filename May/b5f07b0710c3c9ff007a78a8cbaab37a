Experts at United Capital Plc attributed the market rally to recovery in share prices driven by rebalancing in the oil market which resulted in 94 per cent rebound in oil prices from 18 dollars per barrel to about 35 dollars per barrel within a month. They also attributed the rally to increasing indications that governments around the world would reopen their economies regardless of the anxiety around COVID-19.
