Kitsao cooked stones for her hungry children A Kenyan woman, Peninah Bahti Kitsao who lives in Mombasa, Kenya has narrated the sad story of her life since the lockdown was declared in her country. She revealed that she has been cooking stones for her children since the coronavirus outbreak. Prior to the lockdown in Kenya, the poor woman worked as a local laundry woman. However, due to the outbreak of Coronavirus, her customer base drastically dwindled and she could no longer raise enough money for feeding. According to reports from BBC, Peninah said she always hoped her children will fall asleep while waiting for the meal (stones) to get ready. Her neighbor, Prisca Momanyi, who was taken aback by the whole act, informed the media about the womanâ€™s plight. Fortunately, after being interviewed by NTV, the woman has been receiving help from people who made donations to her bank account after being touched by her story. The widow said she could not believe people would come to her rescue the way they did, calling everything a big miracle. Source
