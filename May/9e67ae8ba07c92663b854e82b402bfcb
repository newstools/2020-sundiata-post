In January this year, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo visited the National War Museum in Umuahia, to commemorate 50 years since the end of the Nigerian Civil War. He left some advice to some elders who witnessed the war. He advised them that as elders, they must make sure that they do not poison the mind of the young. “Our children are showing us that is possible to forge friendship and bonds across ethnic and religious lines that are even stronger than family ties. “This in itself evokes the possibilities of UNITY in Diversity”, Osinbajo said. The video of his speech began trending Sunday morning on the tail of the #BiafraHeroesDay, observed on 30 May. It also came with its own hashtag #OsinbajoonBiafra.
