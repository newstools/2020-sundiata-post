By Oluwakemi Oladipo  Lagos  –  The management of Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Ikorodu, says whoever will succeed the current rector must be capable of taking the institution to the next level.The management gave the condition in a statement signed by Mr Olanrewaju Kuye, Director Information and Public Relations of LASPOTECH, on Sunday.It gave the assurance that the selection process of the successor – which would be organised by the Lagos State Government – would be devoid of favouritism.“Appointments are made on merit and performances during the selection process,” it said.The management said that there were eminently qualified academics – within and outside the polytechnic for the job, adding that alleged antagonistic position of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) on the issue had no basis.“The attention of the polytechnic’s management has been drawn to a press statement issued by the union concerning the incoming rector.“The union said that it would be suicidal to appoint allies of the outgoing Rector, Mr Samuel Sogunro, to succeed him at the completion of his tenure.“It should be noted that the union known as Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics has not held any congress in the last two years.“This followed a subsisting order of a competent court of Justice Obaseki of National Industrial Court, Lagos, restraining holding of any congress until the determination of a substantive suit against ASUP, LASPOTECH Chapter,” it said.The management also said that there were no executives of ASUP, LASPOTECH, since the dissolution of the union’s executive by its general congress in June 2018.“These faceless group obviously, for reasons only known to them, want a puppet, who will always be railroaded into dancing to their tunes, installed as the next rector.“Their disposition toward continuous industrial disharmony, including unreasonable demands regardless of the dictates of the Lagos State Government, is well known,” it said.
