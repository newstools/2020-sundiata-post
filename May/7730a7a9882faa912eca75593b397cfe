Akwa Ibom State Government said it has not authorised the resumption of schools, physically or virtually, for the 2019/2020 academic year. It threatened that any school, either public or private, that has resumed would have its operational licence withdrawn and defaulters prosecuted. The Commissioner for Education, Nse Essien, issued the warning in Uyo on Monday. Essien said he has been informed that some private schools have commenced online resumption and have asked parents to pay school fees, adding that the government would announce the resumption of schools in the state when it is convinced of the health safety of the children. He said, “Resumption of schools for the third term 2019/2020 school year will be announced when government is convinced that our children will be safe in schools. “No school both (private or public) is authorized to start the 3rd term school year, either in schools environment or online. “I have been reliably informed that some private schools have already started the 3rd term online and have asked parents and guardians to pay school fees and purchase digital gadget for their wards. “This should be discontinued forthwith. Any school that goes contrary to this instructions will have its license withdrawn and will be prosecuted.” Source
