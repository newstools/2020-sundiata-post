Hope Uzodinma has directed that work be expedited on the renovation of official residence of speaker and deputy speaker of Imo House of Assembly.The state’s Commissioner for information and Strategy, Mr Declan Emelumba said this while interacting with newsmen in Owerri on Friday. Emelumba said that the move was part of governor’s effort towards restoring the dignity of governance in the state. He said that the speaker and his deputy had spent almost one year in hotel accommodation conducting serious government business in same locations, a situation which he said made the process of governance look unserious. ” The government of Uzodimma believes in dignity of government and governance. A situation where the speaker and his deputy live in hotel accommodation is unacceptable to him. ” This is why he has made it possible for the official residences of the leaders of the legislative arm to be renovated. In a few weeks they will move in,” he said. The commissioner, however, said that with the development, all the heads of arms of government in the state would settled in their official quarters. (NAN)
