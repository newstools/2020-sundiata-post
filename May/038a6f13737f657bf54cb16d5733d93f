According to The PUNCH, the Medical Director, Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, Dr Bowale Abimbola, has tested positive for COVID-19. A source, who confided in The PUNCH, said Bowale who tested positive about a week ago was receiving treatment at the Landmark isolation centre. The source said, “He was one of the doctors tested recently at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba. His result and that of two other doctors came out positive. He is currently receiving treatment in one of the isolation centres in Lagos.” The Chairman, Medical Guild, Lagos, Dr Oluwajimi Sodipo, had on April 23 told our correspondent that three doctors at the Alimosho General Hospital and the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, tested positive for COVID-19. However, the Director of Public Affairs, Ministry of Health, Tunbosun Ogunbanwo, denied that Abimbola was positive. He said, “This man has been working, even before the index case. So, he could decide to rest. Nobody should make a conclusion until the person came out personally to reveal his status. To the best of my knowledge, he is not positive.” Meanwhile, the Lagos State Government on Thursday said it had discharged 12 more COVID-19 patients after they tested negative twice for the virus after treatment at the isolation facilities. The state Ministry of Health, via its Twitter handle @LSMOH, said the number of discharged patients from the isolation centres in the state was now 199. Source
