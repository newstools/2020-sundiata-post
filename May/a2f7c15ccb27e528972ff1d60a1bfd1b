Africa’s frontline female pop star, Tiwa Savage, has said that she might have to go naked in her next musical video. Tiwa, 40, said this in an interview with BBC, while speaking on what to expect from her forthcoming album titled ‘Celia’. “I might just have to go butt naked in my next video, because I don’t know what else I’m going to have to do to top that one!,” Tiwa Savage said. “And, just to put it out there, this was done in Nigeria. All the cast is Nigerian, the director, the AP, everybody is Nigerian.” Tiwa added she might end up shooting her next video at home using her iPhone because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’re going through this pandemic, so the idea was I want to let them know that I’m still a boss, that I’m still beautiful, that I’m still African. “So this pandemic has really opened my heart to the real situation of where the world is right now,” she said. She also opened up on suffering anxiety disorder which is caused by a physical health problem. She made this known on her social media page, as she gave a short shout-out to others with similar condition. Taking to her Twitter page, she wrote; “Special prayers for those of us who suffer from anxiety attacks.” Source
