By George Odok  Calabar  –  The Cross River Traditional Rulers’ Council, on Thursday, commended Gov. Ben Ayade for his proactive measures, saying this had kept the state free of coronavirus.The council, in a statement issued by its Chairman, Etinyin Etim Okon-Edet in Calabar and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), described the feat as unprecedented.The council said that the recent visit of a team of Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 from Abuja, led by Dr Omobolanle Olowu, had not only confirmed the coronavirus free status of the state but had also scored the state first in all indices.“The traditional rulers in the state, therefore, commend the ingenuity and pragmatic efforts of Gov. Ayade and the entire COVID-19 team in preventing the spread of the virus through early closure of boundaries and provision of face masks.“While other states and the Federal Government were locking down all means of livelihood, our dear governor only closed the boundaries and allowed economic activities to thrive, but with the enforcement of no face masks, no movement,” the council said.The royal fathers, therefore, appealed to the Federal Government and other international organisations to support the state, considering its state of finances to enable it sustain the feat.“We want to assure our amiable governor that we will continue to prevent importation of the virus into the state,” the council said.
