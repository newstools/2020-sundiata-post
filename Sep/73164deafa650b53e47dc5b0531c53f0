By Ahmed Kaigama Bauchi  – Gov. Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State on Thursday promised to fish out corrupt civil servants, who are ruining the interest. Mohammed stated this during an interactive session with stakeholders on challenges associated with the payment of salaries in the state. “This government, will no matter the odds in the system, definitely get rid of all our saboteurs who are bent on bringing down Bauchi state. ”In 2015, salaries stood at N4.5 billion but it we now need N7 billion in 2020 to pay salaries. “Embargo was placed on employment, We have retirees, yet we need N7 billion to pay salaries? “So, you can see the gross corruption going on in the state civil service, people do not want us to get to the root of the matter,’’ he said. Mohammed said that most of the corrupt practices take place in the Health Management Board, Education and Pensions Boards, among others. ”We many cases of double salaries, ghost workers collecting salaries, 100 ghost doctors, among others. “We lack a credible nominal roll that will drive payroll in the state civil service,’’ he added. Mohammed urged the stakeholders to come up with suggestions to check fraudulent allowances and salaries in the state. He, however, said that to address the challenges, the state government engaged the services of Consultant Dynatech Solutions Systems Ltd, to handle the issues of salaries and payroll in the state. The governor said the consultant had begun to ”unravel huge corruption” in all sectors. (NAN)
