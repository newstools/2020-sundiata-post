Former president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, has made it clear that it is wrong for courts to decide outcome of elections. He said elections should be decided by ballots and not by courts. Jonathan stated this while speaking on The Osasu Show Symposium 2020. According to him, electronic voting is the only way to get to credible elections in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. “For elections to be democratic, that means that the outcome of the elections must depend on the ballot, not any other institution, not even the court. “If the ballots don’t decide who wins, then we are not practicing democracy. “And if we are now in a situation where people use force of arms and thugs to win elections, then we can’t say we are practicing democracy,” he said.
