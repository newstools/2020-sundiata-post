Rebecca “Nengi” Hampson, a Big Brother Naija housemate, has said she will not address anything that happened in the house when she comes out of the show. The Bayelsa-born former model revealed this on Wednesday during a conversation with Kiddwaya in the garden. According to her, she would not address anything that comes out of the house but continue with her normal life. “I’m not perfect; whatever happened in the house has gone. “When I’m out, I’ll continue my normal life and do not need to address anything from here,” Nengi told Kiddwaya. A viral video had emerged of Ozo allegedly touching Nengi’s breast in bed. Nengi was also seen in shower with Kiddwaya and stirred speculations of a possible relationship with the billionaire’s son outside the house. Source
