President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday warned his Ministers to channel their requests to meet him through his Chief of Staff (CoS), Ibrahim Gambari. He made this clear while speaking at the first-year ministerial performance review retreat of his administration, in Abuja on Tuesday. He said matters related to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) should be handled by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF). “Let me also reiterate that all submissions for my attention or meeting requests should be channelled through the Chief of Staff. “While all federal Executive council matters should be coordinated through the secretary to the government of the federation,” Buhari said. This is the second time the president would give such a directive to ministers. The first time was in 2019, when Buhari asked them to submit such requests through his former CoS, Abba Kyari. Source
