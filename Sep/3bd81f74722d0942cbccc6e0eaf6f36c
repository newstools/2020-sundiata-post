The Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ, Cross River State Council Chairman, Victor Udu, who led a delegation to cover the PDP’s Northern Senatorial primary election in Ogoja, has condemned the mayhem that trailed the event. Men of the Nigeria Police who claimed to be on a mission at the venue, tear-gassed a team of journalists led by the State NUJ Chairman. Victor who in strong terms condemned the action of the Policemen said: “I have not seen anything near this scale before, where the security men refused to recognise anybody, even when journalists identified themselves with their tags. “The security men said they were out on a mission. It’s a shame. Its deplorable that a Senatorial by-elections could degenerate to this level. It’s indeed unfortunate and a shame to our democracy. “The Policeman pointed a gun at journalists and said every other person is an enemy and immediately opened teargas on us and we scampered for our safety.” As at press time, the Police in the State is yet to officially react to allegation by the NUJ.
