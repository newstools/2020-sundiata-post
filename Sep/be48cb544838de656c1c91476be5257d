It was reported earlier today that there was jubilation at the command headquarters in Port Harcourt on Saturday as men of the Rivers State Police Command arrested a most-wanted armed robber and kidnapper popularly known as Bobisky. According to The PUNCH, Governor Nyesom Wike had earlier placed a N30 million bounty on Bobisky’s head, saying he will reward any member of the public who can provide useful information that will lead to the arrest of the criminal. Bobisky, whose real name is Honest Digbara, was arrested alive early Saturday at Korokoro in the Tai Local Government Area in a sting operation led by the Divisional Police Officer of Bori, Superintendent Bako Angbashim. He was said to be attending a funeral when policemen and vigilantes acting on a tip stormed the area but on sighting them, he opened fire leading to a gun battle which, on the spot, claimed the life of his younger brother said to be his driver. Bobisky, a terror to many residents in the Ogoni area of the state, has been linked to most of the criminal activities recorded in the area. He was paraded at the headquarters of the command on Mosco Road, Port Harcourt. He later died on the spot of multiple gunshot injuries and machete wounds sustained during the crossfire. Addressing journalists, the state police commissioner, Joseph Mukan, said, “He was arrested through credible information at Korokoro Community in Tai LGA where he was hibernating with his gang of killers. “On sighting the police, they engaged us and in a return fire, his driver was fatally wounded, while he was arrested alive.” Mukan warned criminal elements to “repent, relocate or face the full weight of the law”.
