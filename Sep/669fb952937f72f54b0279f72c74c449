And I pray this happens sooner than later. “As a government, we will make our efforts to improve these situations because that is the mandate given to us by the people. “We will do the little we can to change things. We have started that good journey in Bayelsa State, through the Prosperity Government of Gov. Douye Diri. I believe we will get to the promised land,” he said.
