Terry Waya, the Nigerian billionaire and father to Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has disclosed what former Abia State Governor, Orji Kalu did for his son, Kiddwaya. Terry Waya during an Instagram live session with Dele Momodu disclosed that Orji Kalu helped Kiddwaya leave the NYSC orientation camp when he was posted for youth service in Abia State. The billionaire said he was displeased when he heard Kiddwaya was going to the camp everyday from Orji Kalu’s house. According to him, he ordered that Kiddwaya be taken back to the orientation camp and allowed to sleep there for the remaining days in order to experience the life of an average Nigerian. Terry Waya said: “When my son was posted to Abia State, Orji Kalu who is my really close friend took it upon himself to cater for him. “He took Kiddwaya away from the orientation camp to his house and had him going from his house daily to the camp. “When I found out, I was angry and told the camp coordinator in charge then to return Kiddwaya to the orientation camp in order for him to experience life there.”
