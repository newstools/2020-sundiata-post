Istanbul  -Turkey won’t allow fans to attend football matches from October, the Turkish Football Federation announced on Thursday, reversing its decision from last week. The first half of the 2020/2021 season will be played without spectators, the federation said, after previously deciding to lift some of the restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, the federation announced that limited numbers of spectators would be permitted back in stadiums, or up to 30 per cent capacity, by October. However, Turkey has seen a rapid increase in coronavirus infections and fatalities. On Wednesday, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said the country was experiencing its second peak. Turkey was forced to suspend the football leagues in March because of the pandemic, resuming them only in June without fans. Since reporting its first infection in March, Turkey has confirmed more than 273,000 cases and 6,400 deaths.
