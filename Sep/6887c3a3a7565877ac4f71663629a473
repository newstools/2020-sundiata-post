Later I decided to go into the house and when I was going, the children followed me,” Ogbonna said.The police chief further said that the command arrested two men, Victor Onyekaci, 23, and Emmanuel Okorie, 25, who were allegedly hired to assassinate one Mark Ogbonna, a politician from Isuikwuato LGA.She said that Ogbonna had alleged in his petition that the suspects, who were dressed in military uniforms, attacked and dispossessed him of his valuables in his house on July 16.She said that the suspects, who were arrested in Imo, where they rented a apartment after the operation, allegedly robbed the man of N400,000 Samsung Galaxy phone, N48,500 Infinix phone, plus N457,000.“The suspects have confessed to the crime and claimed that they were sent by one Uche (surname unknown) to assassinate the complainant,” Agbede said.She said that the command was making frantic efforts to arrest the kingpin and also recover the stolen items.She also said that the command arrested 29-year-old Chika Obinna and 25-year-old Nancy Chris for allegedly belonging to a syndicate that specialised in snatching motorcycles at gunpoints.The police commissioner also said that operatives of the command, togetber with local vigilance group and youths of Amokwe and Item communities, arrested 14 alleged members of Vikings and Aro fraternity on Monday.Agbede also spoke on the efforts of the police force to discipline erring personnel, especially those involved in the shooting to death of some innocent residents in Aba and Ohafia.She said that the operative involved in the recent Aba killing, who dropped his gun and escaped, later surrendered himself, even after the command placed a N5 million ransom on him.She said that all the operatives involved in the recent reckless killings in Abia had been arrested, detained, given orderly room trial and dismissed.She said they would soon be charged to court, in addition to all the 47 suspects so far arrested and undergoing investigation.
