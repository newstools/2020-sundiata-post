The international advocacy organisation, Global Citizen, and the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) have partnered to create the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund (NSSF), a fund for Nigerians by Nigerians to combat the devastating effects brought on the citizens by COVID-19 and its associated restrictions. The pandemic has impacted the lives of every Nigerian with healthcare systems becoming overwhelmed and needing critical support, the fund organisers said in a statement on Thursday. The initiative will aim to raise an initial $50 million funding target to combat the devastating impact of the pandemic on Nigerians. The fund is also aimed at supporting vulnerable groups, strengthen Nigeria’s healthcare systems, and re-skill the Nigerian youth for a post-COVID era. Chairman of the Global Citizen Nigeria, Mr Babatunde Folawiyo, in the Thursday statement, called for the support of all well-meaning Nigerians. “Now is the time that we can make a difference, whether you are a corporate or an individual, there is a role for you. “In order for this fund to be a success, we need the whole country to get behind us and donate.” He also said grants will be awarded to fund projects that support the three core objectives of NSSF.
