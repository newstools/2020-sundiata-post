The Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has tackled former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu over his recent boast that he can bring back Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, to Nigeria. Recall that Senator Kalu had yesterday pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari government to allow him convince Kanu to stop his Biafra agitation. National Leader of BNYL, Princewill Chimezie Richard, in a statement on Wednesday, said that some Igbo politicians are opportunists using the name of Biafra to seek relevance in Nigeria politics. “What Orji Kalu is saying is rhetoric, as an Igbo man he knows deep down his heart that Biafra is a spirit, kill any of us the struggle continues,” he said “Arrest and any of us, the struggle continues. Whoever that he may manage to convince to end the agitation, the struggle continues. “Biafra project is not funded by politicians but freewill donations by Biafrans abroad.” He said that the BNYL will come up with a strategy on how to use their grassroots structures to frustrate erring politicians in their region. He warned that should the politicians become a hindrance to restoration of Biafra it could lead to frustration of Igbo Presidency 2023. Source
