Washington  -The U.S. is placing sanctions on International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda over the continued investigations of U.S. persons, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday. Also being added to the sanctions list is Phakiso Mochochoko, the head of the ICC’s jurisdiction division.
