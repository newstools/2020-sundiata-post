By Martins Abochol Jalingo  -Gov. Darius Ishaku of Taraba, on Tuesday urged the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Responsibility Commission (RMAFC), to consider the state’s natural endowment toward allocating enhanced revenue to it.
Ishaku, who made the request in Jalingo at a two-day sensitisation and advocacy tour of the state by RMAFC, also urged the commission to review the revenue allocation formula to the nations federating units to reflect changing realities.
The governor, who was represented by Mrs Suzy Nathan, Head of Service of the state, noted that the state was predominantly agrarian.
He called for collaboration between the Federal and State Governments in taping and transforming both the human and natural resources in the state to create wealth.
The governor directed the state and Local Government officials to cooperate with the commission to achieve the desired results.
Earlier, Mr Solomon Elisha, the Taraba Commissioner for Budget and Planning, said that the tour would provide opportunity for other component units of the federation to contribute to the revenue allocation formula dialogue.
Elisha expressed optimism that the tour would give the sub-nationals the opportunity to solicit for more funds to be devolved to them.
In his remarks, Dr Chris Akomas, Federal Commissioner in charge of Indices and Disbursement in the commission, said that the commission embarked on the advocacy toward the review of indices for sharing of horizontal revenue.
Akomas said that all component units must co-own the review process and decried the discrepancies in data from states and local governments during revenue allocation.
He said that the commission was determined to establish a uniform figure that would ensure fairness and equitable distribution of revenue.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the interaction drew stakeholders from all revenue generating agencies, including heads of account and local government administrators. (NAN)
