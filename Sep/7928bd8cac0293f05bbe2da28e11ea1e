Ozo last week, stated that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Nengi while on the other hand, the Beauty Queen had made it clear that she doesn’t want a relationship with him. He Said; “The good news is that Nengi has said that because of Obsessive Compulsory Disorder, OCD, measures, she’s no longer interested in me. So we are done. “It’s okay if she wants to have another experience with someone else. At this point, I’m done with her.”
