Erica, a Big Brother Naija 2020 housemate, has warned Neo against revealing her secret to other housemates. Erica, while engaging in a discussion about sexual escapades in the house, had told Neo that she has done everything sexual with Kiddwaya. Recall that the Lockdown housemate, Erica and Kiddwaya, were last month caught having s*x in the house. The actress said she was embarrassed when Biggie played her ‘strike clip’, and that she believes some of her fans would hate her for something she did in the Head of House lounge. Erica to Neo: “I hope Big Brother doesn’t show to viewers everything that I and Kiddwaya did in the HOH room. “We did everything intimate while in the HOH room. Don’t told tell anyone my secret, if not I will beat you.” Neo asked if he was the only housemate she told the secret and she affirmed. He, however, promised to be loyal.
