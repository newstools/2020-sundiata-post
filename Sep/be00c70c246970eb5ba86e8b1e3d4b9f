By Abubakar Ahmed Gusau  -The Chairman, Zamfara House of Assembly Committee on Education, Alhaji Yusuf Kanoma has charged education administrators in the state to brace up and tackle the challenges in the state’s education sector.Kanoma gave the charge in his goodwill message at a UNICEF-supported interactive session on inclusion of life skills in school curriculum held in Gusau on Wednesday.“I am highly disappointed in the non-participation of the state’s Commissioner of Women and Children Affairs, Chairman of the state Universal Basic Education Board and Executive Secretaries of the state Female Education and Mass Education Boards.“The State House of Assembly will not allow government workers to abuse their offices and l want them to know, as the Chairman of Education Committee of the House managing the sector, that they should either take their jobs seriously or leave.“These life skills are very necessary for our children to live noble lives but those responsible in facilitating the resilience of the children are unfortunately not showing concern,” he said.Also, Alhaji Abubakar Dogo, Chairman of the state School-Based Management Committee (SBMC), emphasised that while relevant stakeholders strive to ensure that the young generation acquire life skills for self reliance, the workshops for such training in schools should be government’s responsibility.“We need to see that we remove our children especially the girls from the streets and make them engineers, scientists, electricians and so on while at the same time they can cook good meals for their homes,” he noted.Earlier, the representative of UNICEF, Mr Mustapha Shehu, said the fund would continue to support the government and people of the state in ensuring brighter future for upcoming generations“It is by so doing that we can jointly help in reducing the current economic hardships faced by our people by an estimated 60 to 70 per cent because we understand that women as good resource managers, if well supported in this respect, will turn our societies for the better,” he said.
