Since photos of Ghanaian version of the Big Brother Naija show surfaced online, social media users have mocked the organisers. Netizens called the show a disgrace. The Ghanaian version which is dubbed “The Big Brethren Ghana” has its programming like what’s currently happening at the Big Brother House in Nigeria. The programme also has suffered several technical glitches since its start and housemates could be seen sleeping on student mattresses in one unkempt room. Earlier, organisers also lied about an affiliation with Multichoice Ghana but the operators of Dstv issued a disclaimer telling Ghanaians not to fall for the lie of a lifestyle programme. Some Ghanaians expressed their anger against organizers of the show for “disgracing the country”, as they fear they might get trolled just like Big Brother Cameroon. This is the first edition of the Biggy 237 kicked off on August 2 with FCFA 10 million as prize money to be won. “Biggy 237 aims at nurturing talent and inspiring hope in young Cameroonians. It is a talent driven show which brings out creativity, innovation and showcase the talent of its contestants. Biggy237 creates a platform to showcase the skills and talents of its contestants, while entertaining the public,” the organizers said. Here are some of the photos and reactions below:  Source
