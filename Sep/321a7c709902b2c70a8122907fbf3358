Donald Trump, the President of the United States of America, has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize. Trump’s nomination is coming weeks after he helped seal a peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. He was nominated by Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of the Norwegian Parliament, who told Fox News that for his merit, Trump deserved it. Gjedde said, “For his merit, I think he has done more trying to create peace between nations than most other Peace Prize nominees.” Source
