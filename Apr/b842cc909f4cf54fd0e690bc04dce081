By Aderemi Bamgbose Okitipupa (Ondo State)  –  The Christain Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called on the Federal Government to be transparent in the distribution of palliatives to vunerable Nigerians during lockdown against COVID-19 spread. Primate Elisha Akinsulere, CAN Chairman, Ondo South Senatorial District Chapter, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Okitipupa that many Nigerians were hungry because of the lockdown. He said that the lockdown affected many businesses and made the citizens vunerable and expecting pallatives. Akinsulere urged that sharing of pallatives should be devoid of sentiments – ethnic, religious and political. “We learnt that the government is sharing palliatives to vunerable citizens; millions are yet to benefit from these palliatives and cash transfer. “Nigerians are hungry and need palliatives to cushion the effects of the lockdown. “Ethnic, religious and political sentiments should not be introduced in the process because we are one. “We appeal to the government to ensure that its officials uphold accountability and transparency in the distribution process for more Nigerians to benefit,” he said. The primate urged Nigerians to continue to pray against the COVID-19 pandemic, avoid gatherings, maintain social distancing and adhere strictly to government precautionary measures, including staying at home, aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19.
