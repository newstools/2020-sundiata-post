Odianosen Okojie, husband of Mercy Johnson, Nollywood actress, has denied reports on the internet that his wife delivered their fourth child. The news was first broken on social media platforms in the early hours of Sunday by Mercy’s colleagues in the movie industry. Pope Obumneme Odonwodo, an actor who is better known as Junior Pope, had taken to his Instagram page to share maternity pictures of the 35-year-old mother with the infant in her arms. In one of the pictures, the couple can be seen flanked by white doctors alongside other people who came to see them. “Congratulation On The Arrival Of Your New Born….. God is indeed The Greatest. We celebrate with you,” he wrote, in a post that has since been taken down. In the same vein, Joyce Kalu, an actress, also congratulated Mercy on the arrival of her newborn. “Our baby is hereeeeeee, make some noise for the youngest Okojie. May the almighty be praised for a safe delivery, may the heavens bless your family… love you big,” she wrote and subsequently took down the post. Okojie, however, took to his Instagram page to disclose that Mercy is yet to put to bed. “I woke up this morning to see countless missed calls and messages congratulating me on the arrival of our new baby,” he wrote. “We are so thankful for the show of love, but my wife @mercyjohnsonokojie has not put to bed yet, it is good news and I will certainly update you all when it happens. “Thank you and God bless.” I woke up this morning to see countless missed calls and messages congratulating me on the arrival of our new baby. We are so thankful for the show of love, but my wife @mercyjohnsonokojie has not put to bed yet, it is good news and I will certainly update you all when it happens. Thank you and God bless.
