Walker said he was embarrassed and apologised to his constituents before disclosing that he told the town’s police chief to treat his wife, Shannon, as he would any citizen violating the “Stay At Home” order. ‘I am embarrassed by this incident and apologize to the citizens of Alton for any embarrassment this incident may cause our City ‘My wife is an adult capable of making her own decisions, and in this instance she exhibited a stunning lack of judgement. She will face “the same consequences for her ill-advised decision as the other individuals caught at the event, he added. All those arrested have been charged for reckless conduct, a misdemeanor punishable by up to nearly a year jail. They are due in court at a later date. Source
