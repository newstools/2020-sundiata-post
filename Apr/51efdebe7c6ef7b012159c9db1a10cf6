We do not have enough hospitals and facilities,” she cautioned.Shinkafi-Bagudu also admonished the leaders of PWDs to avoid social gatherings, maintain physical spacing and stay at home, where necessary.Earlier, Executive Secretary of the state’s Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr Abubakar Kaoje, said the meeting was part of Mrs Bagudu’s sustained diligent efforts to ensure that all groups, including the vulnerable, were sensitised on COVID-19.Kaoje, however, said it was worthy of note that the state had not recorded any outbreak of the disease.He commended the measures put in place by the Bagudu-led administration to curb outbreak of the disease.In his response, Chairman of the PWDs, Abdullahi Aliyu, expressed gratitude to the governor’s wife for involving their group in her awareness campaign of the COVID-19 Pandemic.Aliyu said: “We are highly impressed with the wife of the Governor, at a time when we thought we have been abandoned, she brought light and hope to us .”He promised to return to his members to impart the knowledge he had acquired on Coronavirus.
