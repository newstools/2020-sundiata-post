By Olawale Akinremi Ibadan – A 28-year-old drug peddler, Tunde Alaka, was on Wednesday sentenced to seven months in prison by Justice Patricia Ajoku of the Federal High Court in Ibadan for unlawful dealing in Indian hemp. Ajoku sentenced Alaka based on the evidence before her as well as the plea bargain agreement the convict entered into with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). “I consider the provisions of Section 270 which makes it possible for anyone who enters a plea bargain agreement to be given a reduced sentence in judgment. “I am also convinced that the convict is now remorseful of his action and willing to turn a new leaf. “With these in mind, Alaka is sentenced to seven months in prison and the sentence starts from the date he was first arrested. “The exhibits found with him are forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria,” the judge stated. Earlier, the counsel to the NDLEA in Oyo State, Mr Raphael Himinkaiye, had told the court that the convict was arraigned on a one- count charge of unlawful dealing in Indian hemp. Himinkaiye stated that the 28-year-old committed the crime on March 3 at Idiarere area of Ibadan. The prosecutor said that NDLEA operatives apprehended Alaka with a sack containing 29.6 kg of the illicit substance while making arrangements to sell it. According to him, the offence is contrary to and punishable under Section 11 (C ) of the NDLEA Act Cap N30 Law of the Federation, 2004. (NAN)
