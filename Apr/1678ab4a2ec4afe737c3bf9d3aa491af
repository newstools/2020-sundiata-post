Some members of the Covid-19 task force team in Cross River State, who were on official duty, have been reportedly attacked in Calabar South area of Cross River State, Daily Trust reports. A member of the team allegedly had his head ripped open by members of a church called Messiah Deliverance Salvation Ministry, located at number 15 Fenton Street, Calabar South Local Government Area. According to explanation by the team, they were at the church to enforce the directive of the governor against church gathering of not more than ten persons. The State Security Adviser, Southern senatorial district, Hon. Ani Esin, confirmed the attack and warned against such unruly behaviour. He said three persons who attacked members of the covid-19 enforcement task force have been arrested. Since the COVID-19 task force team began enforcement weeks back, there have been questions about their modus operandi with the public as cases of abuse have been recorded by the task force and against them.
