London – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was remaining in isolation on Friday as he still had mild symptoms of the coronavirus including a high temperature seven days after he tested positive for the virus. “Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom. “I still have a temperature so in accordance with government advice I must continue my self-isolation until that symptom itself goes,” Johnson said in a video message. Johnson announced a week ago that he had tested positive and would be isolating in Downing Street. The officials said on Friday that the death toll in the United Kingdom among those who had tested positive for the virus had risen by 684 to 3,605, up 23% on the previous day. (Reuters/NAN)
