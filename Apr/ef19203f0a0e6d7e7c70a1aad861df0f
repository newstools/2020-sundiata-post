Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun, has revealed that he sometimes goes to the extreme when he has to stand for his national teammates against Gernot Rohr. The former Mainz man joined the national team in 2014 and since then has been a regular for the Eagles. Balogun said since his teammates knew he could speak German like Rohr, he’s the natural choice when his teammates want to speak to the manager on a training schedule. Balogun, who spoke on Instagram, said, “I do challenge the coach sometimes, it helps that we both speak German. “Sometimes, when the discussions are heated, the other players will say ‘this Balogun is crazy oh’, but it’s all for the good of the team and constructive. “Other times players like (Odion) Ighalo might come to me and say, “Balogun go and talk to your German father now “, when the players want to change or to try something. “I love the squad, being there and it’s never acrimonious, always for the best of the squad.” Source
