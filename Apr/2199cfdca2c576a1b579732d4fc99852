Most of us have already lost count of the days we’ve been in quarantine, working at home in pajamas and forgetting when we last had real human interaction.

Reeve appeared Tuesday on “Good Morning America” segment on American network, ABC News talking about pharmacies using drones to deliver prescriptions to patients.
