The extension of the lockdown order by another 14 days has been described by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State as ‘necessary’. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday extended the order to curtail the spread of Coronavirus was a necessary sacrifice in the interest of the nation and the citizens. Tunde Oladunjoye, Publicity Secretary, Ogun State APC Caretaker Committee stated this in a statement on Monday in Abeokuta. Oladunjoye said as painful as the extra lockdown days could be, it was a necessary sacrifice to reduce and eventually eradicate the Coronavirus pandemic from the nation. “In the last few days, Britain has witnessed close to 1,000 daily deaths; while America witnessed about 2,000 deaths in single day from coronavirus. “There are global complaints of inadequate equipment, medications and bed space, even as frontline workers continue to be exposed to the ravaging virus, for which a cure is yet to be found. “The powerful nations have been rendered powerless by the coronavirus pandemic. Most of these countries have also unavoidably, extended their lockdowns. “It is, therefore, inevitable that we must support government at various levels to curb the spread and cure the infected, even as painful as such measures may appear,” he said. The APC caretaker publicity secretary applauded President Muhammadu Buhari for decision to increase the social investment recipients by one million households, from 2.6 to 3.6 million. “We advice that priority be given to states that are yet to benefit or whose figures of beneficiaries are abysmally low,” he said. He advised citizens and political leaders to continue to lead by example by obeying government’s directives to the letter. He also urged security agents not to rest on their oars, but continue in being vigilant to preemptively nip in the bud, nefarious activities of criminals. Source
