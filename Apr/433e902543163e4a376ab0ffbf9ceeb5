FFK while reacting to the story, said there is not truth in it and blasted those peddling it. Taking to his Twitter handle to react, he wrote: “It is not true that Abba Kyari, the Chief of Staff to @MBuhari, is dead. Those that are behind that rumour are vicious and heartless. I remain opposed to the @MBuhari admin. but to wish or proclaim someone dead simply because you disagree with him politically is unacceptable.” Source
