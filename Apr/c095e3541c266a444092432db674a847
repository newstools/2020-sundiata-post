Singer Waconzy has accused celebrity blogger, Linda Ikeji of working for Antichrist after a post she made about US President Donald Trump. Trump had tweeted in celebration of Palm Sunday: ”Palm Sunday is the beginning of a Holy week for many people of Faith and a great day to lift our voices in Prayer. I will be tuning into Pastor @greglaurie at @harvestorg Church in Riverside, California tomorrow at 11:00 A.M. Eastern.” In a blog post, Linda Ikeji gave a caption which didn’t sit well with Waconzy who reacted as seen below: “@officiallindaikeji has started promoting the Anti-christ again. Trump NEVER said God dosent exist. Read his tweet ! Linda ikeji has seen another opportunity to promote the anti-christ doctrines. . Fake woman who was rejected by her baby father with all her millions  . What has she gained apart from sorrow ?.She is powerless guys ! She is fake news !! Linda ikeji is anti-christ. Simple !!
