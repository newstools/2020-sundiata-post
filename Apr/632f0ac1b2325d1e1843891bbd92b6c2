By Joy Mbachi  Awka – Mr Kenneth Nweke, a Senior Physics Teacher at Kenneth Dike Memorial Secondary School, Awka, has called on students in Anambra to take the Radio Online Teaching initiated by the government seriously.Nweke said this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) shortly after delivering one of his online teachings at the ABS FM 88.5 in Awka.He said that the radio online teaching was initiated by the Ministry of Basic Education, under the watch of Prof. Kate Omenugha, and described the initiative as highly commendable.Nweke urged the students to ask their parents to buy a radio set for them, to enable them to tune to the station at 11a.m on days of the teaching, to boost their knowledge pending when schools would resume.“Every SS3 student preparing for the external examination should see the online teaching as a wakeup call to meet up with the challenges in their academic pursuit caused by COVID-19.“The lockdown period is not meant for the students to stay back home to sleep, watch television or idle away, the government has done noble by initiating the idea,” he said.Nweke, who had lectured on alternating current circuit, said it was an advanced topic in physics adding that he preferred to start with advanced topics to make it easier for the students to understand.“Most teachers teach their student the easier part of physics and when these students go for external exams they are faced with advanced topics and they perform below average.“I decided to teach this advanced topic because that is what they meet in their external examination and once equipped with rudiments of the subjects they will excel,” he saidHe urged parents to key into the initiative of the government and empower their children to learn, rather than encourage them to engage in acts of malpractice.
