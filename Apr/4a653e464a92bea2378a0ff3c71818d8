The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs on Tuesday called on Muslims to observe the practice of social distancing when looking out for the moon in the forthcoming Ramadan. The organisation specifically advised that Muslim fateful should look for the moon at their residences without going out in groups. The Deputy Secretary-General of NSCIA, Prof. Salisu Shehu, in a statement quoted its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, as telling the Nigerian Muslim Ummah to search for the crescent of Ramadan 1441 AH immediately after sunset on, April 23. The statement partly read, “Consequent upon the advice of the National Moon Sighting Committee, the President-General enjoins the Nigerian Muslim Ummah to search for the crescent of Ramadan 1441 AH immediately after sunset on Thursday, April 23, 2020, which is equivalent to 29th Sha’aban 1441 AH. “If the crescent is sighted by Muslims of impeccable character on the said evening, then His Eminence would declare Friday, April 24, 2020 as the first day of Ramadan 1441 AH. If, however, the crescent is not sighted that day, then, Saturday, April 25, 2020 automatically becomes the first of Ramadan, 1441 AH. “At the same time, His Eminence also directs the Muslim Ummah to practise social distancing when looking out for the crescent and specifically advises that people should look for the crescent at their residences without going out in groups.” Source
