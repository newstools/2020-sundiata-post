Results from New York state’s first coronavirus antibody tests found that approximately 21 per cent of 1,300 New York City residents tested positive. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the findings at his daily press briefing on Thursday. The percentage of positive test results in the city implies that approximately 1.6 million out of the 8.4 million people in the five boroughs have already been infected with the virus. Mr Cuomo stressed the results were preliminary, but data will improve over time as more testing is done. Testing for antibodies was conducted over two days in 19 counties and 40 localities, at grocery stores and other large retailers. A total of 3,000 people were tested statewide.
