Ireland’s Prime Minister has shown he is a leader worthy of emulation by re-registering as a medical practitioner to help his country during the Coronavirus crisis. Varadkar worked as a doctor for seven years before leaving the profession to become a politician. His name was removed from the medical register in 2013. His office has now revealed that he rejoined the medical register in March, and offered his services to Ireland’s Health Service Executive to work one shift a week ‘Many of his family and friends are working in the health service. He wanted to help out even in a small way,’ a spokesperson for his office added. The Irish Times reported that Mr. Varadkar is helping out with phone assessments. Anybody who may have been exposed to the virus is initially tested over the phone. On Sunday, Ireland confirmed 21 more deaths from Coronavirus, taking their total to 158, while cases from the disease rose to 4,994. Source
