A Nigerian woman has courted drama on social media by saying she can’t date a man who earns N100K monthly. She made this known while being interviewed on a TV program. According to her, she can only date a man who makes N250,000 monthly, but still, she can’t marry such a man. She further stated that it will be difficult to marry a man who earns N500,000 as they may face difficulties in paying for their children’s school fees.
