By Olajide Idowu Osogbo  –  Mr Timothy Owoeye, the Speaker of Osun House of Assembly, on Wednesday directed the House Committee on Health and principal officers to visit all the designated COVID-19 isolation centres in the state. Owoeye gave the directive at an emergency plenary held to deliberate on COVID-19 and the way forward. He said the assembly would be playing its legislative role in ensuring the virus was curtailed in the state. Owoeye stated that the emergency session was borne out of the need to support the state government in the fight against the pandemic. The Speaker admitted that the state was in a dire situation and could only achieve more with a functional assembly. The assembly, he added, was rising up to the challenge by supporting the state government to check the spread of the virus. He commended Gov. Gboyega Oyetola for his pro-activeness in ensuring that the virus was curtailed in the state, adding that the assembly would give its full support to the executive in the fight against the virus. The lawmakers also passed the “Osun State College of Health Technology Ilesa Establishment Bill 2020” after it was read for the third time. Owoeye said the bill, when assented to, would lead to an upgrade of the School of Health Technology in Ilesa to a college to make the institution autonomous. The speaker, who commended his colleagues for their contribution to the passage of the bill, called on the governor to give assent to the bill. (NAN)
