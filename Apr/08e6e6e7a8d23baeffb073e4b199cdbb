By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Muslims in the country and all over the world as they begin this year’s 30-day fast following the announcement of sighting of the moon by Sultan of Sokoto. “I congratulate all Muslims as they commence this year’s Ramadan fast which is depicted by self-denial, universal brotherhood, austerity and helping relatives and needy people,” said the President in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Friday night by Garba Shehu, his spokesman. President Buhari described Ramadan 2020 as a challenge, falling in the period of the global pandemic, which has spread to more than 200 nations, with virtually all countries advising citizens to avoid large gatherings and have their prayers and meals (suhoor and iftar) individually or with family at home. “In this Ramadan period, the kind of socializing you are used to now risks spreading the Coronavirus,” the President cautioned Muslims, while enjoining them to refrain from those Ramadan rituals and traditions such as group meals and congregational prayers that have been put on hold by Muslim religious authorities all over the world. President Buhari urged Muslims to endure and not to use the Coronavirus as an excuse not to participate in the Ramadan fast, unless such abstention is warranted by the excuses clearly outlined by health and religious authorities. He wished Muslims in the country and the world all the blessings of the holy month.
