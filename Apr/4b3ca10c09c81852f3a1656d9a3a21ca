The Prime Minister has today called Colonel Tom Moore a ‘point of light in our lives’ as he wished him a happy 100th birthday and thanked him for helping to pull the nation together through the coronavirus pandemic. On an overwhelming day, Captain Tom was promoted to Honorary Colonel by the Queen to mark his birthday after he captured the hearts of the nation by raising £29 million for the NHS by doing laps of his garden. The 100-year-old World War II veteran was then treated to two poignant flypasts to mark his big day, fighting back tears as the historic aircraft roared through the skies in his honour this morning. Boris Johnson told Colonel Tom on BBC Breakfast: ‘Your heroic efforts have lifted the spirits of the entire nation. You’ve created a channel to enable millions to say a heartfelt thank you to the remarkable men and women in our NHS who are doing the most astounding job. ‘There is a tradition going back some years now where the Prime Minister takes a moment each day to thank someone for their service to others. ‘By recognising them as a point of light. Captain Tom, that is exactly what you are – a point of light in all our lives. So, on behalf of the whole country, thank you, and have a very special 100th birthday.’ Source: Dailymail.co.uk
