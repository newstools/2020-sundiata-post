By Muhyideen Jimoh  Abuja – The national Chief Imam of Al-Habibiyyah Islamic Society, Shiek Fuad Adeyemi has called for support for the less privileged following the stay-at-home order aimed at curtailing the spread of the Coronavirus (Covid-19). The Imam made the call on Friday in Abuja at the distribution of food items by the Society to some less privileged in Guzape community in the FCT. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the gesture was meant to cushion the effect of the lockdown on some less privileged in the FCT. Adeyemi said that about 30 bags of rice, spaghetti and condiments were distributed to the people while stressing the need for everyone to stay at home. “The distribution of these food materials is Al-Habibiyyah’s little way of supporting the less privileged in this difficult time,” he said. Adeyemi however called for more advocacy on the need for regular hand washing, social distancing and basic hygiene to stop the spread of the virus in the country. ” In Islam, it is stated that whenever there is a pandemic, we should stay at home and obey advice of health and constituted authorities to contain the pandemic. “We also want to use this medium to call on government at all levels, well meaning Nigerians and faith-based organisations to continue to support the less privileged, as we collectively defeat this pandemic,” Adeyemi added. He said the Al-Habibiyyah Islamic Society will continue to pray for the quick containment of the pandemic so that life can return to normal in the country. (NAN)
