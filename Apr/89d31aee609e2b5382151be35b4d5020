By BASSEY ANTHONY, Uyo There is tension in the oil city of Eket over rumour that the founder of a popular church and his wife may have contracted COVID-19. The wife was said to have returned from London where she allegedly contracted the virus. The church founder also owns a high-brow hotel in Eket, our correspondent gathered. At the time of filing this report, details of the pastor and his wife were still sketchy even as fear has enveloped Eket with residents remaining indoors. It was not clear whether the couple are being isolated and observed in a medical facility or in their hospitality outfit. But Eket residents have called on the government to step in immediately to avert the virus taking its toll if the hotelier and wife are confirmed positive. The Nation gathered when the wife came back from London with symptoms of COVID-19, she went to Ibom Specialist Hospital (ISH) Uyo after being to some private hospitals. At ISH, she was said to have demanded that her samples be taken but the medical personnel in charge refused. It was not until she reportedly called the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Ebonyi State and Governor Udom Emmanuel that her samples were taken. Though no one knew the result of the test, it was further learnt she returned to Eket where she hosted a party attended by not less than 25 persons. (The Nation)
