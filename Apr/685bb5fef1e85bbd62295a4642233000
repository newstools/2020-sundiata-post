Fred the Godson has died after contracting the coronavirus earlier this month. He was 35. The Bronx rapper, whose real name is Frederick Thomas, revealed on Instagram that he was on a ventilator in the hospital on April 6. His wife, LeeAnn Jemmott, told News 12 on April 8 that a doctor said he wasn’t faring well. “It was just like — he’s gone and he’s gonna die, that’s it. I don’t even know how I felt, I just felt like I was going to die,” she said. However, she added that he had started to have some positive progress while in the hospital, with the ventilator supporting him 70 percent rather than 100 percent. Fred, who has two children with Jemmott, ultimately passed from the deadly virus Thursday, a rep confirmed to Complex. The news of the 35-year-old’s death originally broke through social media, with people paying tribute to his life. Fred the Godson was a prominent rapper in New York for over a decade. He has previously collaborated with artists such as Diddy, Meek Mill and Pusha T. This year, he dropped both a solo project and a collaboration with Jay Pharoah. I’m in here wit this Corvus 19 shit!
