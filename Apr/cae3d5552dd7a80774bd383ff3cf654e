The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has slammed Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State for his blatant intimidation, harassment and attacks on journalists and media houses in the state. SERAP on Wednesday condemned the bam on the correspondent of Sun newspaper, Chijioke Agwu, and Vanguard Newspaper, Peter Okutu, from entering Government House and government facilities in the State for life.” Umahi took the action over a report on the Lassa Fever outbreak in Ebonyi. SERAP in a statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, said the action is a blatant violation of the right to freedom of expression and media freedom as guaranteed by the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended) and the country’s international obligations including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party. “We will pursue appropriate legal action nationally and internationally against Ebonyi State authorities if this illegality is not reversed within 48 hours of the publication of this statement.” SERAP urged the Umahi to immediately reverse the purported ban, and allowing journalists and media houses to freely cover the activities of his government. “Nigerians expect their leaders to show a greater level of transparency and accountability and to explain and take responsibility for what they are doing rather than threatening, intimidating, harassing and banning journalists and media houses from covering their public functions. “These journalists and media houses are simply doing their work and playing their constitutional roles.” “The ban clearly runs counter to the notion of a free marketplace of ideas, necessary to serve the best interests of the public. Barring journalists undermines Nigeria’s pledges on democratic reforms and the rule of law and must stop now,” SERAP added. Source
