The Rivers State Government has arrested 22 traders entering the state from neighbouring Abia and Anambra states for disobeying the stateâ€™s directive on border closure meant to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The traders, who were arrested in three different sets, they came from Anambra and Abia states to do business in Rivers State. They said they were not aware that the lockdown was serious in Rivers State, because in their respective states, traders were allowed to move around. One of the traders, Mrs. Uju Nnamdi noted that she was on her way to the state to sell her wares. She said though she was aware of the lockdown of the state, she never knew her trading would endanger the state. Driver of the truck that brought them, Mr. Chijioke John said he was travelling to Onne from Onitsha, but picked the women at Ihiala in Anambra State. He said the women pleaded with him to help them and he took pity on them, since they were standing on the road. The female traders were reportedly conveyed in a container to conceal their movement into the state but driver said he opened one of the container doors for the traders to get ventilation Rivers State Health Commissioner, Prof. Chike Princewill said that the 22 traders would be screened to ascertain their coronavirus status. He said that the screening was vital to ensure that they did not infect the state adding that his ministry stationed medical personnel to carry out the responsibility. He said after the screening, the traders would be tried in line with the extant laws in place to protect Rivers people. Princewill said it was embarrassing that a transporter would convey human beings in a container, just to beat the law. The accused persons were later tried in a magistrate court assigned for that purpose by the Chief Judge of Rivers State. The Nation
