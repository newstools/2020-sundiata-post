Nollywood actress, Onyii Alex has called for the thumbs-up for Igbo ladies, whom she claims are usually not in the habit of waiting for their men to cater for them, but would rather go out in the society to hustle to meet their individual needs. Speaking against the backdrop of increased trolling of ladies by men in the social media, given the hardship occasioned by the lockdown and social distancing, which has seen many people remain at home due to COVID-19 scourge, she said such was not substantially applicable to Igbo ladies. Her reply was particularly a lashout at one Stanley Chibuna, popularly known as Funny Bone who had stated during an Instalive video that Igbo girls graduate from school and wait for rich husbands, wondering how such hardworking Igbo ladies would earn such a tag. She wrote: “Since this pandemic men just Dey use girls Dey trend, even the married men. Biko who no like better thing? But one thing I’m sure of is that Igbo girls Dey hustle die. Dey know where Dey r coming from. Forget social media oo! Shoutout to all my Igbo sisters that don’t wait for any man…An average Igbo girl is embedded with beauty and a strong hustle spirit we learnt from our mothers. F**k that broke men mentality. IgboGirls are allergic to poverty #ProudlyIGbo#IgboAmakA#” See the post: “Since this pandemic men just Dey use girls Dey trend even the married men. Biko who no like better thing?
