Commissioner for Health in Lagos state, Professor Akin Abayomi, has said that 80 per cent of the calls received on the CORONA emergency lines are hoax calls “from irresponsible members of the society.” Speaking at press conference on Monday April 6, the Commissioner said most people call for fun, pranks or to pass insults to health workers, and this has been very distracting in the management of coronavirus outbreak in the state and nationwide. He said 11% of the calls are from people seeking information about the viral disease, 9% are from people feeling symptoms while 0.4% of the calls are red flags.
