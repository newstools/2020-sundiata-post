Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has disclosed that Coronavirus will be around for a long time as most countries are still in the early stages of dealing with the deadly disease. During a virtual press conference on Wednesday night April 22, Mr. Tedros said: ‘Most countries are still in the early stages of their epidemics and some that were affected early in the pandemic are starting to see a resurgence of cases. ‘Make no mistake: we have a long way to go. This virus will be with us for a long time. He noted there has been progress in western Europe but said there were ‘worrying upward trends’ in early epidemics in part of Africa and central and South America. The WHO’s top emergencies expert Dr. Mike Ryan warned against opening up global travel too quickly, saying it would require ‘careful risk management’. Source
