Cuban health workers Land in South Africa A delegation of more than 200 health professionals from Cuba has arrived in South Africa to bolster support in the fight against COVID-19 in South Africa, according to EWN News. The delegation was welcomed by the South African government who thanked the Cuban doctors with Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Ngakula saying the relationship between Cuba and South Africa would continue. “You’re not the first brigade and you will not be the last one. Thank you, thank you.” Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosana Dlamini-Zuma thanked the doctors in the spirit of historic political figures. “In the spirit of Fidel [Castro], OR [Tambo] and in the spirit of [Nelson] Mandela – we thank you very much.” Cuban ambassador to South Africa Rodolfo Benitez Verson has told doctors from his country they receive support from South Africans. Verson also told his doctors about the support from government. “I can assure you that we have the full support of the South Africans; there can be no more honourable nation than the one entrusted in you.’ The doctors will be staying in quarantine at a hotel in Pretoria for 14 days before starting their health work in the country.
