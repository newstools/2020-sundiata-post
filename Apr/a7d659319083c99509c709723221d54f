Former U.S. President Barack Obama will endorse his vice president, Joe Biden, for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, according to a person close to Obama. The endorsement is expected to come in a video to be released later on Tuesday, the person said. Obama’s expected backing would come a day after Biden’s last remaining rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, provided his endorsement on Monday. From Reuters
