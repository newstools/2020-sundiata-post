By EricJames Ochigbo  Abuja  – The Minority Caucus of the House of Representatives has called on Nigerians to maximise the benefits of Ramadan to pray for the nation to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement by the Minority Leader, Rep. Ndudi Elumelu, the caucus urged Nigerians to care for one another, particularly, the less privileged, the sick and the bereaved at this critical time. “Nigerians are known for our prayerfulness, trust in God and love for one another. The Ramadan, coming at this time, beckons on us all to rekindle these virtues as we jettison all distractions and collectively pray and fight to defeat COVID-19 in our dear country and the world in general, he said. Elumelu expressed optimism that the scourge will soon be a thing of the past and called on Nigerians not to despair or surrender to despondency. The lawmaker called on leaders at all levels to redouble their commitment towards the wellbeing of the people, especially in the area of palliatives, security and healthcare. He urged Nigerians to continue to adhere to all health safety directives including those on social distancing, personal, family and community hygiene, which are vital in the fight against the plague. Elumelu called on Nigerians to use the holy month of Ramadan to pray for the divine intervention of the Almighty Allah. (NAN)
