It’s a sanitary liner. In other words, what many women use to catch blood when they have their periods. Well. I had a friend who worked as a flight attendant and she got into a mild argument with a guy who insisted on having EVERYTHING that was free or complimentary on the flight.

At one point during the flight a lady asked for a sanitary pad to help her with an ’emergency’ situation. He insisted he should have one too – cos you know, it’s free, right? My friend tried to reason with him. I’m not sure if his English was 100%, because he insisted again and seemed to assume the pad was one of these… A sleep mask.​​​Upon receiving his sanitary pad he proceeded to peel the paper backing off and expose the sticky side; he stuck the thing over his eyes and soon afterwards fell asleep… THE END.
