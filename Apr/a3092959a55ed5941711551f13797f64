Deaths from the coronavirus in Canada have risen by almost 7 per cent in a single day, official data posted by the public health agency showed on Monday. The number of people who had died of Covid-19 in the country rose to 1,611 from the day earlier. In a statement posted shortly before 11am the health agency said the figure for those diagnosed with the coronavirus had climbed to 35,392. On Sunday the nation had recorded 1,506 deaths as a result of the disease and 33,922 confirmed cases. The first presumptive case of coronavirus was confirmed in Canada in January. All of Canada’s provinces have declared states of emergency and called on residents to practice social distancing measures, according to The Guardian. Last Wednesday Justin Trudeau said that the country’s coronavirus lockdown will last “many more weeks.” “We need to continue doing what we are doing now for many more weeks,” Mr Trudeau said. The prime minister warned if the economy is reopened too soon, all the sacrifices the public had made to stem the spread of the virus could be fruitless. The country currently has over 37,000 confirmed positive cases of the virus according to data from the Johns Hopkins University. The disease, which often only causes mild flu-like symptoms, sometimes causes serious complications that can be fatal. There have been over 2,450,000 cases of Covid-19 worldwide. Source: Yahoo News
