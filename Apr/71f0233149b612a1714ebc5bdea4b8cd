ABUJA — THE federal government, Wednesday, dismissed report in some quarters (not Sundiata Post) that it has postponed resumption of schools any time soon until November, this year. The government through the Federal Ministry of Education described the report as “the handiwork of an illiterate, who, going by the content of his release also appears to be mental.” A statement by the ministry through its Director, Press and Public Relations, Bem Goong, asked “parents, students and the general public to disregard the release in its entirety”, adding that “there is no iota of truth about the release.” “Efforts are on to track the author, and if found to be a normal human being, he or she will be prosecuted. For now, everything about the release points to a mental lunatic,” the statement said. It read in full: “The Federal Ministry of Education has disowned a press release circulating on multiple social media platforms, insinuating that schools will reopen in November 2020, describing the release as the handiwork of an illiterate, who, going by the content of his release also appears to be mental. “The ministry is asking parents, students and the general public to disregard the release in its entirety, adding that there is no iota of truth about the release. Efforts are on to track the author, and if found to be a normal human being, he or she will be prosecuted. For now, everything about the release points to a mental lunatic.
