By Christian Njoku Calabar –   Former Super Eagles Goalkeeper, Mr Etta Egbe has lauded the resolve of Cross River government to solicit for private sponsorship in managing the state-owned football clubs, Rovers of Calabar and their female counterpart, Pelican Stars Football Club.Egbe who gave the commendation in an interview with journalists in Calabar on Monday, said it was the best thing for the state to do for both clubs, if they (clubs) were to continue in the Nigerian leagues.News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalled that some days ago, the Commissioner for Sports in the state, Offu Aya, in reaction to protest by the Pelican Stars over 10 months unpaid salaries and allowances, appealed for private sponsorship of both clubs as the state resources to sustain them was dwindling.According to Egbe, “It is just the best thing that can happen to both clubs; football financing is capital intensive and so private and corporate bodies will enhance smoother sponsorship.“The players of the Rovers FC themselves were allegedly owed over one year of salaries and allowances before same plight befell their female counterparts.“When players of the Pelican Stars FC blocked the governor’s office over non-payment of their salaries, some of them also called on the government to hand over the club to private bodies, arguing that footballing is now serious business,” he said.It would also be recalled that some years ago, UNICEM, now known as Lafarge PLC, partnered the state government to manage Rovers of Calabar but the state government reportedly failed to discharge its own side of the contractual agreement, leading to the pull out of the former.
