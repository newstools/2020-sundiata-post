Former Chelsea and England goalkeeper Peter Bonetti has died aged 78 after a long illness. Bonetti was described by Chelsea as a “goalkeeping superstar of the 1960s and 1970s” and “one of our indisputably all-time great players”. He was part of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning squad but was unused throughout the tournament. Bonetti made seven England appearances and featured in the 1970 World Cup quarter-final defeat by West Germany. As well as playing 729 times for Chelsea, Bonetti also had brief spells at American side St Louis Stars, Dundee United and Woking FC during a career which spanned more than three decades. Only former Chelsea captain Ron Harris has made more appearances for the Blues and Bonetti held the record for the most clean sheets until January 2014, when Petr Cech surpassed him. Source
