Prof. Akpa, made the claim to newsmen in a press conference held in Enugu on Wednesday. According to him, he had already made energy health medicines superficially meant to boost the human immune system and others meant to directly attack the virus to ensure 100 per cent successful cure. He, however, challenged health institution to bring any patient. He said: “I will challenge any health institution or agency to bring any known case of coronavirus to me and see how it will disappear within a few days. “If the Permanent Secretary of Enugu State Ministry of Health or the State Government approaches me to cure any of the known cases of coronavirus in the state I will voluntarily do so without attaching any condition to it. “I thank God for using me to find the cure to a disease that is already threatening to wipe out the whole earth,” he said. Prof Akpa blamed the outbreak on the quest to be supreme superhuman species among the Chinese and others. “These people during their meditation engage in what is known as Astral Travelling in which the spirit leaves the body and travel to these planets to probe what is there and at times steal certain substances which they bring back to the earth. “So be that some of these unworthy activities of the human beings affected the planet Mercury and in reaction now sends the deadly radiations of the coronavirus to the earth. “Finally, however, I will teach you, journalists, some self-protective habits and also give each of you a bottle of Immunity Enhancement. “Before ending this briefing I like to inform you that all the planets have also their positive effects on the human beings here on earth, you can find this in many of my works,” Akpa said.
