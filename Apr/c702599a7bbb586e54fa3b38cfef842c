Elo Edremoda, Warri Fire on Monday gutted a part of the Sapele Correctional Centre in Delta state, during a protest by inmates in the facility. The Nation gathered that the inmates were protesting against a new policy that prevents them from receiving visitors. They were also said to be protesting against poor treatment by officials of the correctional centre. The cause of the fire was still sketchy, as of the time of filing this report, but the inmates were said to perceive the new policy as a threat to their welfare, hence the demonstration. It will be noted that visitors often donate food items among other necessities to the inmates, during visits. Meanwhile, there has been heavy presence of security operatives stationed around the facility to prevent any escape attempt by the inmates. When contacted, Commissioner of Police, Delta State Command, CP Hafiz Inuwa, confirmed the incident. He noted that authorities at the Centre are looking into the issue. “They are demonstrating over the newly introduced policy that correctional service there has stopped allowing visitors to see them and give them money. So they see it as a new policy aimed at going against their own welfare. “As of the time the DPO called me, they were trying to persuade them to calm down. Meanwhile, the police have taken position outside the prison yard to ensure that no room is given for escape,” Inuwa stated. The Nation
