LAGOS – More facts have emerged on death of Globe Motors Chairman, Sir Willie Anumudu. Reports earlier today, including by News Express, indicated that Sir Willie Anumudu, one of the biggest names in Nigeria’s automobile business, died of Coronavirus (COVID-19). A close friend of the automobile mogul, however, called News Express to dismiss the claim. “He did not die of Coronavirus but died in his house in Lagos of heart attack,” the source said. Another friend of the Anumdus, OVATION Publisher Dele Momodu also took to his Instagram handle to say that the Globe Motors boss, aged 68, did not die of COVID-19. Sir Willie, according to Chief Momodu, “suffered some health challenges few days ago and was tested for COVID-19 which came out negative. He was to be air-lifted to Germany this morning but died about 4am. A jolly good fellow, Willy was everybody’s friend and a prominent Lagos socialite. “As at the time of his death, he was happily married to his effervescent wife, NKIRU, who sadly was in London when the tragedy occurred in Lagos early this morning. He is survived by four children, UZOMA, ENYINNA, ZINNA and ZIKKY.” •News Express
