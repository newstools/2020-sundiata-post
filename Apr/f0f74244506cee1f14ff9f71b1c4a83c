Nigerian Olympic silver medalist, Blessing Okagbare has filed for divorce from her husband, former Super Eagles player, Igho Otegheri, according to LIB. This is after a stint of marital crisis. The couple got married in Sapele, Delta State in November 2014 in a wedding ceremony which was attended by family, friends and loved ones. However 6 years later, the couple who relocated to the United States have gone their seperate ways amid allegations of infidelity, laziness and other irreconciliable differences. LIB further gathered that Blessing Okagbare initiated the divorce process which has led to rows of face-offs between members of their families. The professional athlete’s family is reportedly yet to return the bride price to her estranged husband’s family. When LIB reached out to Mr Otegheri on the divorce saga, he said; “She has said all the stories, I don’t have anything to say. I leave everything to God. Thank you.” Source
