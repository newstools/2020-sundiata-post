I took the moment to slide into Don J’s DM and told him I needed money for a project. He sent me N150,000. I knew I would share this story someday. “Although, I didn’t use the money for what I said I wanted to use it for… (I’m sorry @DONJAZZY) , that moment shaped me further. I have always loved sharing but Don J’s act made me pray and ask God to bless me as such. I never reach that level, but I will keep hustling… “P.S – I used the money to buy BlackBerry Bold 5 and shared the rest with my siblings… I forgot to add. The Blackberry Bold 5didn’t even last a year. It was stolen from me. And that was in Abuad“ The award-winning producer replied his tweet saying, “awww I swear I can’t remember at all. Such a small world. I am super proud of what you have achieved so far. May GOD continue to bless you bro. Congrats on every.” Source
