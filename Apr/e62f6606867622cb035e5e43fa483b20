The Federal Government has reacted to the controversy triggered by Conditional Cash Transfer scheme which is currently ongoing in some states across the country. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Farouq who addressed claims of two members of a family being paid N20,000 each recently, said it was highly impossible for such to happen. Speaking at the Presidential Task Force briefing on COVID-19 on April 21, Sadiya said members of same family cannot receive money more than once. The Minister said; “This is near impossible because the process involved is a very tedious process, where all critical stakeholders in the community are involved. “The community leaders and the faith-based organisations, the youths and women leaders in that particular community are the ones that come up with the list of poor and vulnerable ones in that community.” Sadiya further disclosed that the Ministry she heads will investigate claims of double payment, even though it would be almost impossible for such to happen.
