Ghanaian dancehall star, Shatta Wale has lashed out at Ghanaian Pastors who are now receiving tithes and offerings online, following a presidential ban on public gatherings in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak in the country. In an interview on 4 Syte TV, Shatta Wale stated that these Pastors only care about money and not the salvation and welfare of their members. Recalling how some Pastors have been receiving offerings for over 30 years, the controversial singer asked what they’ve all done with it to make the lives of their members better following the oubreak of Coronavirus. He said; “We are in a period where I don’t think pastors should even try that…you understand me? Your members come to church and they give collection, now there is a problem. The collections they gave like for the past 30 years, where are those collections? “okay like you can say your collections for the past 30 years, where can I buy some rice or yam or things for you. but as at now that Coronavirus is killing your church members, some of your church members don’t even have cars, some don’t have houses…they rent and you’re still collecting tithes online? “These are scammers like hard sakawa guys and that’s why some people like Kennedy Agyapong will get pissed and start bombarding them. As a man of God, don’t you have pity?” Here is the video below; They are all scammers – Shatta Wale slams Pastors collecting tithes and offering online in spite of #Coronavirus outbreak A post shared by  Lindaikejiblog (@lindaikejiblogofficial) on Apr 8, 2020 at 1:37am PDT Source
