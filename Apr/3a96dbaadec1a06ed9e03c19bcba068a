Palpable tension has enveloped the Port Harcourt suburbs affected by yesterday’s total lockdown order of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state to check the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. This is because as you read this, the affected areas seem to have been cordoned off with regular parade of a combined force of stern looking soldiers, navy, police, immigration, Civil Defence, etc, yelling out orders. The complete lockdown started today and would last till further notice according to Governor Wike. The affected areas are Elekahia, Rumuomasi, Stadium Road and Rumuobiokani. ECD reporters say that Rumubiakani, market road Rumumasi/Stadium/Elekahia area residents could be seen peering through window blinds of their apartments while others watched from in front of their homes as security vehicles roared through the deserted roads and streets. Said a resident who proffered anonymity, “It is like a war zone. Before now, we were partially locked in as we were able to go out and buy personal needs but now, we are all peeping through the windows. Gov Wike’s announcement yesterday has made the security personnel to get very angry. I guess it is for our own good.”
