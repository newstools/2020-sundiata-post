Thieves stole a French bulldog puppy from a carer’s home while she helped people with dementia in a gruelling shift during the coronavirus pandemic. Dion Taha, from Sheffield, Yorkshire, has put up a £1,000 reward for information which leads to the safe return of three-month-old Bella. The 46-year-old was out at work looking after people suffering from dementia on Saturday when burglars took her pup. Dion returned home to find her front door had been forced open, possessions scattered across the floor, documents rummaged through and some silver jewellery taken. ‘Bella is normally at the window waiting for me when I get back from work but she wasn’t there,’ Dion said. ‘The door was open and there were papers everywhere. I knew someone had been in, as if they’d been looking for paperwork because there were other things that could have been stolen but weren’t. ‘Bella wasn’t there so I phoned the police and forensics came.’ Dion has asked for anyone in the local area to check CCTV for suspicious activity between 6am and 1pm in the Darnall suburb. The social media appeal, including a dedicated Facebook group, has taken off with many similar pups being flagged as found across the country but there has been no sign of Bella yet. Dion has revealed that she has been on the receiving end of hoax calls attempting to obtain money saying they will ‘breed the death out of her’ unless they receive payment. Although she has admitted that she is ‘overwhelmed’ with those offering to help find Bella, who she only got four weeks ago. The support worker of 15 years continued: ‘It’s overwhelming the response that I’ve had. I’m just taken back by it. I can’t believe how many people have responded and tried to help.
