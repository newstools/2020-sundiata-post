By Clara Egbogota The Chief Executive Officer, Murtala Muhammed Foundation (MMF), Mrs Aisha Oyebode-Muhammed, has called for urgent and coordinated actions by stakeholders to tackle the aggressive mysterious disease killing people in Kano State.Oyebode-Muhammed, the eldest child of former Head of State, late Gen. Murtala Muhammed, made the call in an open letter addressed to Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and made available to newsmen on Monday in Lagos.She also called for “a war-time” strategy among other measures, to check the increasing deaths of residents in Kano State over the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic”.Oyebode-Muhammed said the situation in her home state deserved “a strong leadership action, and not to adopt a fatalist view of the situation or remain in denial”.According to her, urgent and coordinated actions must be taken and the support of all stakeholders must be sought to redress the situation.“Your Excellency, we are looking to you for direction and leadership at this time.“We assure you of our support and that of many well-meaning individuals and institutions within and outside the state.“Kano State already has considerable developmental challenges that threaten to be compounded by this pandemic.“We have a huge population, endemic poverty and high rates of illiteracy amongst other indicators that make us extremely vulnerable.“This portends horrendous catastrophe for our people if, God forbid, we lose the war against COVID 19.“I, therefore, entreat you to take necessary action to urgently address this predicament and save the people of Kano,” she said.Oyebode-Muhammed, however, recommended a seven-point step as the way forward, which according to her, demanded urgent and coordinated actions.“Some of the steps I would like to suggest are: to declare a State of Emergency in Kano State with immediate effect.“Exercise your powers as Governor to lockdown the entire Kano State and work with the Nigerian security forces to enforce this.“Embark on a community awareness programme to sensitise all indigenes and residents of the state to protocols that have been prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) including: handwashing, social distancing, use of face masks and self-isolation.“Adopt wartime strategies to minimise the spread of the virus, which would include commandeering existing infrastructure as isolation centres, in particular, repurposing boarding schools and university accommodation as much as needed beds for the sick.“Practice intense tracing, categorisation and management of contacts.“Provide healthcare workers on the frontline with adequate personal protective equipment (PPEs).“Adopt NCDC guidelines in dealing with those who have been confirmed infected, as well as enforce adherence to guidelines for the burial of the deceased.”She said that Nigeria and indeed Africa, had been lucky, as the nation’s treatment outcomes so far had been remarkable.
