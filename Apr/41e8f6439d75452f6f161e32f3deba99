Cross River State health commisioner, Betta Edu has lashed out at the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) over a recent comment about some Nigerian states who are yet to record Coronavirus cases. The Director-general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu had earlier stated that Coronavirus will get to every state in Nigeria as he pointed out that some states are yet to send in enough samples for tests. He averred that some states which are yet to record cases of COVID-19 are either negligent in testing and tracing, or actively hiding the disease within their territories. However Betta Edu who slammed the agency over the comment while addressing newsmen on Wednesday April 29, stated that she wants the pressure on Cross River State to stop. She also alleged that some residents of the state have been receiving text messages in which they are promised millions if they can claim they are Coronavirus positive. The health commissioner also stated that they are expected to conduct Coronavirus test in a community with 500,000 people with just 50 test kits.
