Senegalese authorities have confirmed reports that they are expecting anti-Covid-19 traditional medicine from Madagascar where the locally prepared potion is being promoted as a remedy to the Coronavirus. Government spokesperson Abdou Latif Coulibaly told public broadcaster RTS that Senegal was ready to test the “miracle” drug, officially known as Covid-Organics. The Covid-Organics is a herbal concoction prepared by researchers from the Madagascan Institute for Applied Research (IMRA), which has cured 60 patients, according to officials in the Island country. “Covid-Organics will be used in prophylaxis, that is to say in preventive, but clinical observations have shown a tendency to its curative effectiveness,” said Dr. Charles Andrianjara, director-general of IMRA. Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina drank the liquid in front of cameras during a public presentation in the country’s capital Antananarivo a few days ago. Senegal president Macky Sall and his DR Congo counterpart Felix Tshisekedi have shown support for the project. However, the World Health Organization (WHO), which did not attend the launch of the drug, noted that there is currently “no evidence” that the potion can “prevent or cure the disease”. (Zimeyet.net)
