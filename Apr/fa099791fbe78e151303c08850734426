The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has urged security agencies to deploy tact while enforcing the lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory. Buhari had, on March 29, ordered the lockdown in the three locations for an initial period of 14 days to tackle the spread of the coronavirus in the country, while some other states have followed suit. The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, who spoke during a live briefing of the task force in Abuja on Friday, stated that reports indicated that there was a high level of compliance with the lockdown orders in Lagos, Ogun and the FCT. Mustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said the Federal Government had ramped up its synergy with the state governments through video conferencing communication and the platform of the governors forum. According to him, the President’s directive is that security agencies should enforce the lockdown order with discretion but Nigerians should be law-abiding. The SGF said, “The PTF finds it very necessary to appeal to our law enforcement agencies to deploy tact and caution in the course of enforcing the rules even in the face of provocation. “We similarly appeal to all Nigerians to be law-abiding, exercise patience and self-restraint. The message from Mr President is that no Nigerian should, on account of these rules, suffer any harm or pains during this period or any other time in our national life. “To the Nigerian traders and businessmen and women, we appeal for resistance to the urge to hike prices of goods and commodities during this period as our compassionate nature must prevail.” Mustapha stated that it was the best time for citizens to be considerate and to show empathy for their fellow countrymen.
