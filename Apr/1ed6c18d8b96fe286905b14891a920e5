Italian luxury shoemaker Sergio Rossi has died aged 84 after being hospitalised with Coronavirus. The designer died on Thursday in the small town of Cesena in central Italy after being admitted into hospital just days earlier, according to Women’s Wear Daily. The brand’s chief executive, Riccardo Sciutto, told the fashion website: ‘He was a master, it was a great pleasure to have met him. He was our spiritual guide and he is today more than ever. “Today everyone at Sergio Rossi joins me in remembering our dear Sergio, the inspiring founder of our dream,’ Mr Sciutto shared on the brand’s Instagram page. He added, “Sergio Rossi was a master, and it is my great honor to have met him and gotten to present him the archive earlier this year. “His vision and approach will remain our guide in the growth of the brand and the business. “He loved women and was able to capture a woman’s femininity in a unique way, creating the perfect extension of a woman’s leg through his shoes. “Our long and glorious history started from his incredible vision and we’ll remember his creativity forever. “He was among the founders of the high-end women’s footwear district in the area of Forlì and Cesena in the mid-20th century,” said Luciana Garbuglia, mayor of San Mauro Pascoli, where Rossi was born in 1935 and where he founded his brand.
