According to him, “The citizens are traumatised by insecurity, poverty, and hunger. The population does not have the capacity to take preventive measures necessary to contain the spread. “The steps taken by developed nations should guide our response to the problem. America, Britain, France, Germany, have a more comprehensive understanding of what the virus can do to the population”. He observed that “The Nigerian reaction, is not as drastic as it should be. We cannot wait for people to start dying before we take precautionary measures”. The legislator lamented the lack of adequate medical laboratories, water, infrastructure and beds in the country to tackle the virus. He also called on the Government of Buhari, to urgently order the mass purchase of ventilators, sanitizers, masks, and toiletries to contain the eventual spread of the virus.
