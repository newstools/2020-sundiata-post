By Uchediunor Augusta Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Some churches in Lagos on Sunday adhered to the  Lagos State Government ( LASG) directives of not having  more than 50 persons during their Sunday services. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports  that the LASG had  last week directed  that every social gathering, including religious houses, should not be more than 50 persons at a time to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Some of the churches visited by NAN correspondent did   not open for worship while a few that opened  did so in batches. The doors to Saints  Mulumba and David Catholic Church  at Lawanson, St Robert’s Catholic Church, Myhoung Barracks, and  St. Denis Catholic Church, Akoka  were locked when NAN visited there. Some members who spoke to NAN from the parishes  cited an internal memo by  Catholic Archbishop  Adewale Martins to suspend Masses for the next four weeks to guard against contacting COVID-19 as their reasons. They said that they followed the Sunday Mass on a private television channel as directed by the Archbishop in his letter to the clergy and  thethe  faithful of the archdiocese. However, some parishes of the  Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) and  the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministry  (MFM) in Shomolu area gathered  for the Sunday service in batches. Some of the churches provided running water  and liquid  soaps  at their main entrances  for their  members to wash their hands before they were allowed into the church building. They also supply them with hand sanitiser to rub their hands and encouraged their members not to sit close to one another while their services lasted. NAN, however, observed that many faithful did not go to their places of worship but held personal communion in their homes. NAN also observed that youths  in some areas took to the streets to play soccer when they were supposed to be in church.(NAN)
