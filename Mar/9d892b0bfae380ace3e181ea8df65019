An evangelist has criticized gospel singer, Mercy Chinwo’s appearance saying she’s not what a “true Christian” should look like . Victor Edet, who prefers to go by Evangelist Victor, shared photos of the “Excess Love” singer and wrote: “YOU can’t be singing gospel songs and be seductive at the same time. A true Christian should look DECENT and not SEDUCTIVE, Mercy Chinwo beware.” Source
