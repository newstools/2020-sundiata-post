From Duku Joel, Damaturu Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Executive Secretary of Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) Dr. Mohammed Goje has confirmed the death of six policemen in Wednesday night attack on Dapchi town by suspected  Boko Haram elements. Dr. Goje who visited Dapchi with the Commissioner for Sports, said his team evacuated the bodies to the Gen. Sani Abatcha Specialist Hospital mortuary where they would be kept for identification by family members before  burial. According to him, the insurgents burnt down the military base in the town and a section of the police station of the town. Other items destroyed by the insurgents are military vehicle and a mobile police bulletproof vehicle. Dapchi is 100km from Damaturu, north of the state. The quiet town came into limelight when over 100 girls including Leah Sharibu were abducted by Boko in their hostel. Confirming the incident, spokesman DCP Frank MBA said the criminals came in four trucks and fully mounted General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG), a sophisticated weapon with a firing range of 700 to 800 metres. He said, “I am stressing this for emphasis because people need to understand it. The highest firearm a policeman carries is an AK47 rifle. The best of AK47 has a range if about 400 metres. “Then, the criminals mounted a GPMG which has a range of about 800 metres. What this means is that no matter the marksmanship of the cops and the quality of their rifle, they are at a disadvantage since the criminals can hide at a distance of about 600 metres, mount their weapons and open fire on their target. “Be that as it may, the place has been cordoned off and the bodies of the gallant policemen moved to the mortuary.” Culled from The Nation
