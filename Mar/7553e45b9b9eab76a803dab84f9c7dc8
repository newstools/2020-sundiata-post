By Habiba Broger Bern – The Swiss government has cancelled scores of sporting and cultural events as a raft of measures aimed at tackling the spread of the coronavirus, code-named COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the events cancelled include football matches, carnivals, concerts, and the Geneva International Motor Show, which usually attracts hundreds of thousands of people from across the world. The motor show usually unveils more than 100 new models. At least 160 exhibitors had planned to attend this year’s event. “We regret this situation, but the health of all participants is our and our exhibitors’ top priority,” Maurice Turrettini, Chairman of the Foundation Board said. The government also announced the suspension of all public and private events capable of attracting more than 1,000 participants until around March 15. The Swiss authorities invoked emergency powers to do so. Also banned was a Catholic mass due to be held for the first time in 500 years on Saturday at the Geneva cathedral – a bastion of the Protestant Reformation. “Large-scale events involving more than 1,000 people are to be banned. “The ban comes into effect immediately and will apply at least until 15 March,” the government said in a statement, after the country registered 15 cases of the coronavirus. The United Nations, which has its second biggest office after New York in Geneva, said it was “assessing the situation”. Its spokesperson Alessandra Vellucci said “obviously we will follow the host-country’s position.” Vellucci also noted that the ban could put in doubt the ongoing Human Rights Council which is due to last until March 20.
