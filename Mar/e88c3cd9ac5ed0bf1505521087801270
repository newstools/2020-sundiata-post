Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has come up with a new claim about the COVID-19 disease ravaging the entire world. According to Fani-Kayode, the dreaded virus was created by the Illuminati for the sole purpose of reducing the world’s population. The term “Illuminati” refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, a secret society. This secret society, founded by a German professor of law, Adam Weishaupt, operated for only a decade, from 1776 to 1785.
The Illuminati used to be a very real group. And even though the society is said not to be in existence anymore, many people still have paranoid beliefs about it. The Coronavirus started in China’s city of Wuhan in 2019 like a joke but has now spread like a wide fire to almost all the countries of the world with thousands of death recorded. As at yesterday, the global death toll on coronavirus was at 12,755. Nigerian government announced 10 new cases in the country. Writing on Twitter on Saturday night, the PDP chieftain said their objective was to create panic and fear, to grant the State more power to control the masses and thirdly, to introduce what he described as the “anti-Covid serum” which will lead to the death of millions. According to the former Minister, “The 1st objective is to create panic and fear. The 2nd is to grant the state more power to control you in the name of protecting you from Covid 19. “The 3rd is to usher in a programme of compulsory mass injections of the anti-Covid serum which will lead to the death of millions. “They want to control humanity and cull the world population. The injection and drug they will introduce to battle, prevent and cure Covid 19 will kill more people than Covid 19 itself. “The Illuminati is at work here. It is called a Hegelian dialectic: problem, reaction, solution.” Source
