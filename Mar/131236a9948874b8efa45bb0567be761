By Amen Gajira Kaura (Kaduna) – Mr Yusuf Mugu, member representing Kaura Constituency at the Kaduna State House of Assembly, has demanded more action from the state government to end incessant killings in communities in his constituency. Mugu told News Agency of Nigeria on Thursday, while reacting to the killings in Kaura and other parts of the state, that it was regrettable. The lawmaker condemned the alleged killings of residents of his constituency and tasked the state government to secure people’s lives and property. “The government should as a matter of urgency, employ all arsenals within its reach to stem the ugly trend which is fast becoming a norm. “It is rather unfortunate that our people can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed without fear of yet another attack,” Mugu said. According to him, the situation was worrisome considering the fact that the farming season would soon set in and farmers had started clearing their fields. He urged the state government to create additional police outposts and increase military presence in local government areas in southern Kaduna. “You will also recall that this attack occurred barely a week ago when two persons were assassinated in Matsirga community in Zangon Kataf local government,” he said. He consoled with the families of the deceased persons and called for more vigilance. Two persons were killed while one other was critically injured in an attack on Wednesday by suspected gunmen at Zangang village, Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State. (NAN)
