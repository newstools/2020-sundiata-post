Istanbul – Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria’s civil war, on Friday agreed on the details of a ceasefire deal in North-Western Syria. According to the Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, both countries would soon commence joint patrol along a major highway in the province. Akar said both countries would create joint coordination centres to monitor a ceasefire in the embattled Idlib province. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Erdogan had agreed to a ceasefire for Idlib, to observe a security corridor along the M4 highway, among other measures. Earlier, Russian military delegation had held talks in Ankara to coordinate the planned measures. “The joint patrols are going to start on March 15,” Akar said. A recent military onslaught by Russia-backed Syrian forces in Idlib had brought Ankara, which backs some rebels, to the brink of open confrontation with Moscow and dozens of Turkish troops were killed. The escalation had displaced 1 million people in Idlib, near the Turkish border. “With the ceasefire development in sight, some locals have started returning to their various homes in Idlib,” he said.
