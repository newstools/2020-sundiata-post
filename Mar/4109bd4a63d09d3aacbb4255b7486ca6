…Charges Uzodinma to Concentrate on His Job Rather than Engage in Unguarded Media War With Performing Governor of Rivers state By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A social cultural group under the auspices of Olu Owerri has condemned the suspension of local government projects and non-payment of Local Government Staff salaries as well as those of state civil servants by Governor Hope Uzodinma since his assumption of office. The group therefore called on Governor Uzodinma to account for the three months (January to March) local government allocation to the Imolites or be ready to face protest. The call was contained in a release signed by the President General, Chief Martin Opara and made available to newsmen by the organization in Owerri after a situation assessment meeting. The group observed that the 27 LGAs have now become a cash cow for the governor who has turned the monthly allocations to his pocket money, whereas all ongoing projects in the LGAs have been suspended, without any new project to justify the massive withdrawal of Local Government funds in the last three months, using complacent and easily manipulated civil servants who have their job to protect. According to the release, the rural dwellers are not happy that road grading / maintainance, sporting complexes projects as well as LGA multiple office complexes initiated by the Local Government Areas under former Gov. Ihedioha, were suspended by the incumbent governor without taking up new projects in the LGAs. The group lamented that the era of looting public funds has returned, wondering why the governor has used every opportunity and pronouncements he has made so far to remind the masses of imminent calamity starring them in the face as if that is the essence of the I’ll fated and conceived supreme court verdict that foisted him on the people. The Olu Owerri therefore advises the habitually unguarded and prodigious governor to retract his steps in the management of scarce public funds and to refrain from continuing his needless media war with the governor of Rivers state..aka Mr projects who is very busy developing infrastructures and turning the fortunes of the state around and concentrate on his job despite the conspiracy that brought him to Douglas house unlike the popular mandate given to Governor Wike by the people of Rivers state for the second term.
