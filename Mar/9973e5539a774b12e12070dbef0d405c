He said that his bruise was treated at a nearby patent medicine store while they left for their guest house where they could pass the night. Recounting further, the source said that after about an hour of their arrival at the guest house the late Yarling began to vomit uncontrollably. He said that it made him call for help and he was rushed to Bingham University Teaching Hospital for treatment but was confirmed dead on arrival.
