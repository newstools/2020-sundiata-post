Well to do people in Turkey have left some food packs and drinks for the poor and needy in their country. Ofcourse with the people not in sight, they left what will keep them for few days on the road, so they could come get it. In Turkey, just like every where in the world, people are practicing social distancing… Watch the very touching video below… Still heartbreaking the outbreak is real and not what we see in the movies… In #Turkey, people have started to leave food packets on the road for the poor and the needy who cannot earn due to #COVIDー19 lockdown. Love you #Turks for representing us. pic.twitter.com/UY1OkWdsyo
