After so much pressure, which my widely shared Saturday Tribune back-page column has added to, the Aso Rock cabal finally forced Buhari, a dementia-plagued, insentient old geezer who masquerades as “president,” to address the nation today on the new Coronavirus. Although his speech was pre-recorded, (which means it wasn’t live), his handlers couldn’t get him to retake the portion where he mispronounced COVID-19 as “Kovik one nine”! And the video clip of the mortifying pronunciational disaster was shared on social media by Buhari’s paid social media aide. Incompetence is supposed to be strong suit of the Buhari regime, but they’re incredibly incompetent at even being incompetent! More crucially, though, the video is powerful, irrefutable evidentiary proof of my assertions (which I repeated in my Saturday Tribune column) that Buhari is too wracked by the ravages of dementia to even know what’s happening around him, much less in the world. There’s no sentient, living being on this earth today— and certainly no world leader—who doesn’t know that there’s a global pandemic tipping over the world that is called the new coronavirus or COVID-19. Apparently, his speech writer avoided “coronavirus” because Buhari’s dementia-inspired speech impediment would make him slur the word. COVID-19 is easier to say, yet Buhari bungled it. He obviously had never heard it said anywhere even when it’s the most commonly heard word on earth now. That is all the evidence you need to know that Buhari is practically in the land of the living dead. As I said in my Saturday column, Nigeria is currently presidentless.
