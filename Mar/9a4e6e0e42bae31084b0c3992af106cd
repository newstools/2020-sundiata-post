The All Progressives Congress (APC), Kano State chapter have asked Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State to create a new emirate for the dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. The APC members made the request yesterday, according to a report by DailyTrust. El-Rufai had last week appointed Sanusi as the chancellor of the Kaduna State University. Before then, he had hours after the dethronement of the emir, appointed him as vice chairman of the board of the state investment promotion agency (KADIP). The governor crowned his support for Sanusi with a visit to Awe in Nasarawa state where the deposed emir was banished. His visit coincided with a court order that freed the former emir from banishment. In a statement signed by the deputy state party chairman, Alhaji Shehu Maigari, the party asked the governor to appoint the deposed emir as the traditional ruler of the new emirate. “Your Excellency, Governor Nasir el-Rufai, this is somebody who worked against the success of APC, your dear party, coming out openly to criticise your mentor (Mr. President) with no concrete reasons or justifications but yet you have decided to treat him like a hero. “Sir, APC Kano Chapter is strongly advising you to create additional emirate in your state like New Kaduna Emirate Council, probably to start from Rigachikun to Kasuwar Magani and install your hero there, so that he can work effectively for his dear party (PDP) over there, instead of giving him those ceremonial positions,” he said Source
