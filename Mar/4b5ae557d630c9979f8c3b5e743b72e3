By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – UNICEF urged the public to trust
information only from verified sources as concerns increase around Covid-19
(coronavirus) globally, with information shared on WhatsApp and other social
media platforms. UNICEF said it has become aware of messages being circulated
that are being falsely attributed to the organization and stressed that all
genuine information can be found on its website, www.unicef.org, including
information on how to protect yourself and loved ones from the virus. People
can also see the WHO website for further updated information. Sundiata Post recalls that UNICEF, in collaboration with
WHO, is supporting the Nigerian government’s response to the outbreak. UNICEF is leading on preventative actions in communities
with risk communication, providing hygiene and medical kits to schools and
health clinics and monitoring the impact of the outbreak to support continuity
of care, education and social services.
