A 50-year old married man, Felix Okon has confessed after being arrested that he enjoys sleeping with small girls. He was arrested for allegedly engaging two under aged girls in sex romp in Lagos. According to PM Express, the suspect, Okon, was arrested at his house, Plot 154 Road, House 11, Federal Housing Gowon Estate, Lagos, after he allegedly defiled two girls aged 14 and 16. The alleged defilement was reported to the Police and he was arrested. He was later transferred to the Gender Section of Police Command for interrogation. The Police alleged that Okon lured the victims to his apartment when his wife and children were not around and engaged them in the dastardly act. It eventually got exposed and the under aged victims confessed and said he had penetrated them but warned them never to tell anybody what happened. The suspect, Okon, admitted that he slept with them but that did not force them into it as he preferred sleeping with small girls of such age despite the fact that he was married. The Police found him culpable and later charged before the Ogba Magistrates Court for defilement. When he was brought to Court, his plea was not taken and he was not granted bail after the prosecutor, Mr. Christopher John, asked the Court to refer the matter to the DPP for advice because of the seriousness of the offence Okon allegedly committed. Thus, the Presiding Magistrate, Mr. P.E. Nwaka, ordered him to be remanded in prison custody and directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send to the DPP for advice while the defendant will remain in custody pending the outcome of the DPPâ€™s advice to determine if the matter will be transferred to the High Court or not. The matter was adjourned till 18th March, 2020, for the report of the DPP to be available. The matter may be transferred to the High Court if the DPP finds him culpable and recommends that he should be tried for the alleged offence. Source
