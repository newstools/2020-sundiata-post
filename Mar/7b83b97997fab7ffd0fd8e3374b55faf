Vienna – The UN watchdog policing Iran’s nuclear deal with major powers on Tuesday admonished Tehran for failing to provide access to two undeclared locations or fully answer its questions about past activities there. Reuters first reported on Monday that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) planned to issue a second report in addition to its regular quarterly update on Iran’s nuclear activities. IAEA rebuked Iran for less than full cooperation in general and for failing to grant UN inspectors access to one or more sites of interest. “Iran has not provided access to the agency to two locations and not engaged in substantive discussions to clarify agency questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities. “The director general calls on Iran to immediately cooperate fully with the agency, including by providing prompt access to the locations specified,” the IAEA second report said. The report added that Iran had informed the IAEA that it “will not recognise any allegation on past activities and does not consider itself obliged to respond to such allegations”. The landmark 2015 nuclear accord, which lifted international sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear activities, has been unravelling since President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018 and imposed sanctions that have throttled Tehran’s oil exports.
