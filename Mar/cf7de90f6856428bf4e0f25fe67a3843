Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has launched a fresh attack on dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi. Omokri, who described Sanusi as a liar, said no billions of dollars went missing during the administration of Jonathan. In a tweet, the former presidential aide stated that only those who are ignorant would believe that Sanusi exposed corruption during the administration of Jonathan. Sanusi, a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, was dethroned as Emir of Kano by the state government for insubordination. Following his dethronement, a series of videos emerged online of Sanusi speaking on how he exposed corruption during Jonathan’s administration. Sanusi had claimed that as CBN governor, he was able to expose and recover billions during the administration of Jonathan. However, Omokri described the revelations by the dethroned Emir as fake. According to Omokri: “Anyone saying Sanusi exposed corruption during @GEJonathan ’s administration is ignorant. There was no $49.8 billion missing. “There was no $22 billion missing. There was no $12 billion missing. There was no $10.8 billion missing. Sanusi lied. He is a liar. Period!”
