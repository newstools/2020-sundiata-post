Paris – European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, on Tuesday said it was halting manufacturing at its sites in France and Spain for four days in response to the coronavirus crisis. “This will allow sufficient time to implement stringent health and safety conditions in terms of hygiene, cleaning and self-distancing, while improving the efficiency of operations under the new working conditions,” Airbus said. The move comes as France is due to implement an Italian-style national lockdown from noon (or 1100 GMT), with people allowed to leave their homes only when it is necessary. However, Spain had since declared a state of emergency, joining Italy and France in enacting drastic measures meant to keep citizens at home. (dpa/NAN)
