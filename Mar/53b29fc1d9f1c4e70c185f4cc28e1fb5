Popular Iranian-born Australia-based Islamic cleric, Mohammad Tawhidi a.k.a Imam of Peace has taken to Twitter to mock President Buhari. He mocked Buhari for not knowing about the coronavirus pandemic that has killed thousands of people as the President gave a speech Sunday March 22 where he was unable to pronounce the name of the virus correctly. Instead of coronavirus or COVID-19 as it is known, Buhari called it CIVIK 1-9. The Imam also lashed out at the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan who according to him thinks Iran and Japan share a border. See his Tweets below:
