Ousted National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole has boasted that no man born of a woman can bring him down because God is with him. Recall that he was suspended by a court in Abuja and asked to stop parading himself as national chairman of APC. The ruling was later set aside by a Federal High Court in Kano after it was declared. Speaking shortly after a meeting with President Buhari, Oshiomhole said: “I am not the best chairman in the world but I have given my all even at the expense of my family welfare and security to ensure I support my party and work sometimes almost 20 hours a day. ”This is to ensure I provide the desired leadership APC needs. “Whatever you do, those who want to fight you will fight you but I know that my tenure will be defined by God and not man and I worry more about what I will be remembered for when I was Chairman rather than how long I was chairman. “He who God stands with no man born of a woman can bring him down.” Source
