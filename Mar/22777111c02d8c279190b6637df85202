Kabul – Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has dissolved the office of chief executive, which is run by his rival, Abdullah Abdullah, Presidential Palace spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said on Wednesday. Speaking at a news conference in Kabul, Sediqqi said that the chief executive office no longer existed in the government’s hierarchy. A two-page decree attributed to Ghani was circulating on social media, in which Ghani ordered that the items in the office should be taken back, and all the forces in charge of the executive office’s security should be shifted to other places. Sediqqi confirmed the authenticity of the decree during the press conference. The national unity government consisting of the two leaders, with Abdullah as CEO and Ghani as president, was formed with U.S. mediation in 2014 after months of political deadlock. Abdullah did not react to the decree, and his spokespeople were unavailable for comment. This new move comes after the rivals both held competing swearing-in ceremonies on Monday. The move widens the stand-off between the two and, according to experts; it weakens the government position in intra-Afghan peace talks with the militant Taliban. On Wednesday, U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad said that if one part of the country was being controlled by the Taliban, another by Ghani and some part by Abdullah, it would a great threat to Afghanistan.
