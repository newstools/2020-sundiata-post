The COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. It was first reported to @WHO on the 31st of December, 2019 in Wuhan, China. Scientists and public health officials are working hard to identify the source of the SARS-CoV-2 which is the virus that causes COVID-19.

The first case in Nigeria was confirmed on Friday, February 27, 2020 in Lagos in a business Italian traveller who arrived Nigeria on February 25, 2020 and became symptomatic on February 26, 2020. Contact tracing is ongoing to identify everyone who has come in contact with the confirmed case. The Government of Nigeria, through the @Fmohnigeria has been strengthening measures to ensure Nigeria is prepared in the event of an outbreak. he multi-sectoral Coronavirus Preparedness Group led by NCDC has been activated to a national Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate response activities. @NCDCgov is working with State Governments to identify and trace contacts of the confirmed case, in Nigeria. The Port Health Services Division of the Department of Public Health has heightened screening and surveillance at the ports of entry, particularly for returning travellers with travel history to countries with ongoing transmission in the last 14 days. Residents of the Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Training Programme (NFELTP) are working closely with staff at Port Health Services to screen, review and analyse the forms used for screening at points of entry.

If you have a patient that matches the case definition above, please contact NCDC to arrange for sample collection and testing on 07032864444. In the last one month, @NCDCgov has conducted rapid assessments of potential treatment centres. This assessment focused on identifying gaps and developing plans to rapidly ensure that we are prepared to manage all cases. Treatment centres are located in the five priority states with international airports; Lagos, Rivers, Enugu, Kano and the Federal Capital Territory. Healthcare workers from these treatment centres have been trained on how to manage COVID-19 cases using approved guidelines. No. The current situation in the country does not warrant a shutdown of daily activities.
