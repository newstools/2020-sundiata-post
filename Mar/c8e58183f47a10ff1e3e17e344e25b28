Berlin – The German Government’s Disease Control Agency on Monday showed some cautious optimism that the increase of coronavirus cases in the country had started slowing down. According to President of the Robert Koch Institute, Lothar Wieler, based on daily analyses, the country is seeing the trend that the exponential growth curve is flattening somewhat. He, however, cautioned that it was too early to disclose it definitively. Wieler nevertheless, expressed optimism that the measures implemented in Germany were already having a visible effect.
