Keshinro was arraigned before the Lagos State Special Offences Court in Ikeja on nine counts bordering on stealing, forgery and fraudulent accounting. PUNCH Metro learnt that Keshinro allegedly forged a Polaris Bank cheque No. 47423262 dated August 16, 2018, in the sum of N340,000 purportedly signed by one Alhaji Kola Oseni. Keshinro, according to the prosecutor, Bilkisu Buhari, was the account manager of Oseni and his company, Baritos Nigeria Limited.

Following the plea of the defendant, the prosecutor urged the court to remand him in a correctional facility and asked for a trial date. However, Keshinro’s counsel, S. Ehizoge, informed the court of a pending bail application dated February 10, 2020, and urged the court to grant his client bail on the most liberal terms.
