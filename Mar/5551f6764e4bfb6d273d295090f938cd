By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Members of the national assembly who recently returned to the country from abroad have been directed  to report themselves at the nearest test centre of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to be tested for coronavirus. This was conveyed to
the leadership of the national assembly in a letter written by Abba Kyari,
Chief of Staff to the President. According to him, the
directive became necessary as some of the returnees had refused being tested at
the airports. Kyari noted in the
letter that “airport screenings are our primary line of defense and
refusal by any citizen to subject to these tests is a threat to our nation.” A copy of the letter
addressed to Olufemi Gbajabiamila, Speaker of House of Representatives, sighted
by The ICIR, urged the speaker to direct such members of the House to
report themselves for test. “Accordingly, you are
kindly requested to direct all members of the House of Representatives who
returned to Nigeria from foreign trips to report themselves to the nearest NCDC
test centre with immediate effect,” Kyari wrote.
