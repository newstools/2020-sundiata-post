By Ummul Idris  Abuja – The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) says the country retains less than 60 per cent of her medical graduates due to brain drain. The President of the association, Dr Francis Faduyile, made this known in an interview with thebNews Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja. He said that the emigration of Nigerian trained doctors to developed and industrialised countries began in the 80s. According to Faduyile, brain drain of doctors is a lingering pandemic in the country has pushed more doctors to move out of the country in search of better and conducive working environment. He ascribed poor remuneration and inadequate health facilities, among other factors, as the major reasons for mass movement of medical doctors from the country.
