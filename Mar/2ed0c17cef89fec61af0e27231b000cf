A woman was whipped on stage for having sex outside marriage in Indonesia to the delight of many spectators watching in the crowd. These horrifying photos show an Indonesian woman dressed in a white veil, kneeling on stage while being whipped by a masked official. The woman was whipped along with seven other people outside a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh. Dozens of people alongside religious officers gathered outside the mosque to watch the offenders as they received their punishment respectively. In the photos, a masked sharia officer known as an ‘algojo’ was pictured canning the offenders between five to 45 lashes on their backs. Public whipping is a common punishment for a range of offences, including gambling, drinking alcohol, and having gay sex or relations outside of marriage in Aceh, which is the only region in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country that imposes Islamic law.
