By Amina Ahmed  Bauchi – The Nigeria Veterinary Medical Association (NVMA),Bauchi chapter,has called for the establishment of Veterinary Hospitals in North East states considering the increasing threat of zoonotic diseases. Zoontic diseases are diseases that derive their origin from animals. Vice chairman of the Association,Dr Abubakar Sadiq, said during a courtesy call on News Agency of Nigeria ((NAN), Bauchi on Thursday that most states had only ‘ Vetrinary Clinics’. He said the call had become imperative, especially now that the entire world was being threatened by coronavirus disease. According to him, clinical activities take place only in clinics and area offices with little or no consumables,equipments and conducive working environment. “In Bauchi for example, veterinary services are provided in a clinic that was built since 1914. “Sixtyfive to 75 percent of human diseases are transmitted from animals to human,which can be prevented if measures are put in place. “COVID 19 was traced to a fish farm in China,typhoid is from the pipe borne water we drink,contaminated by animals and not treated properly,”he said. Speaking on abbattoirs, Sadiq most states had only slaughter slabs , with no adequate supervision of proceedings. On rabbies , he said Bauchi recorded 36 cases from January 2019 to date, affecting over 10 people. The Vice Chairman said the association intended partnering with stakeholders to check the incessant cases of cruelty to animals in the state. In his response,NAN Bauchi Zonal manager, Malam Abdullahi Salihu,said that with the outbreak of COVID 19 and other emerging diseases, the role of veterinary doctors was paramount in public health. He expressed the readiness of NAN Bauchi Zonal Office to partner with NVMA in educating the populace. (NAN)
