Madrid/Paris – Travellers scrambled at European airports to board flights to U.S. on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced sweeping travel restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus. The 30-day travel order will apply to citizens of 26 European countries but exclude Britain and Ireland as well as American citizens. The travel ban is to take effect from midnight on Friday. Trump’s announcement has disrupted the travel plans of thousands of people and hit airlines already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus has now been branded a pandemic and has killed more than 4,600 people worldwide. EU disapproves of U.S. travel ban, taken unilaterally and without consultation. (Reuters/NAN)
