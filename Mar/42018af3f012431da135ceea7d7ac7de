The Bayelsa State House of Assembly has approved a request from Governor Douye Diri to collect N2.9 billion loan he will use to buy operational vehicles for himself, deputy governor, and other top government functionaries. According to Punch, the Assembly granted the loan for Diri during a plenary on Tuesday following a motion moved by the Leader of the House, Monday Bubou-Obolo. Bubou-Obolo, who is the immediate past Speaker of the Assembly, said the proposed facility had a repayment tenure of 36 months. The motion received unanimous support from the lawmakers and the request was approved for the governor. Diri was inaugurated on February 14 after the Supreme Court nullified the election of the former governor-elect, David Lyon of the All Progressives Congress. Meanwhile, the Assembly called on the state Ministry of Health and relevant agencies to come up with measures to prevent a possible outbreak of coronavirus in the state. It urged the Governor Diri-led administration to invest more on enlightenment campaigns on the coronavirus pandemic, especially in the different dialects, in order to keep the entire public informed.
