The pastor and his wife welcomed triplets after 18 years of marriage A man of God, Rev. Dr. Eseme Unem and his ever beautiful wife, Pastor Esther, last week dedicated their triplets, two girls and a boy, to God at a special thanksgiving service with friends, family, well wishes and of course, church members in attendance. The Guardian reported that the couple had waited 18 years after the birth of their first child, a girl, who is an undergraduate, before God blessed the family with these bundles of joy. Speaking about her experience, the elated mother recalled how she prayed, fasted and sowed seed for the fruit of the womb, before God at His own appointed time answered the family. She said there were low moments, when she had to grapple with the reality of failed expectations, but was thankful God saw them through such periods. She revealed other challenges she faced during the pregnancy, and how she spent six months in the hospital receiving treatment before the delivery. Esther advised expectant couples to be patient, focus on God and shun the temptation to run to different churches looking for solution. The husband thanked God for granting them the grace to be steadfast and not bow before strange altars, during their trying period. He said: “It got to a point it seemed we were giving up. But we persevered and God answered us.” The General Overseer said they fortified themselves against external pressure, which helped them to be steadfast in the face of challenges.
