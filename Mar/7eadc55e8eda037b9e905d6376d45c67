By Grace Alegba and Olayinka Olawale  Lagos The Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Gbolahan Lawal, on Sunday advised young people to explore opportunities in the agriculture value-chain to earn better living. Lawal told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in an interview that there were job opportunities in various segments of agriculture from cultivation to selling the produce in the market. He said he would want it to be on record that it was during his tenure that 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were met. “I will be glad if agriculture can reduce poverty, create jobs, engender zero-hunger, sustain life below water, life on land and provide decent work and economic growth. “2020 is a year of action for SDGs and the state has already set up strategies to achieve that in the agriculture space. “Once we can get that done, I will be very glad,’’ he said. NAN reports that the 17 SDGs include No Poverty; Zero Hunger; Good Health and Well-being; Quality Education; Gender Equality; Clean Water and Sanitation; Affordable and Clean Energy. Others are Decent Work; Economic Growth and Industry; Innovation and Infrastructure; Reduced Inequality; Sustainable Cities and Communities; Responsible Consumption and Production. They also include, Climate Action; Life below Water; Life on Land; Peace and Justice; Strong Institutions as well as Partnerships to achieve the Goals. The commissioner assured youths in Lagos State that government would continue to support agriculture, urging them to take advantage of the opportunities. (NAN)
