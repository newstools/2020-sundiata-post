By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu –  The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has commenced massive sensitisation of drivers in motor-parks in Enugu on social distancing in their commercial vehicles to check spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that  Enugu State Government had earlier directed commercial vehicle drivers to carry only two passengers per long seat in their buses as well as only one passengers and the driver in the front. The government also directed commercial tricycle operators to only carry two passengers behind; while taxi should carry two passengers at the back and one passenger with the driver at the front of the car. The FRSC Sector Command in Enugu State, Mr Ogbonnaya Kalu, disclosed this to NAN in Enugu on Saturday. Kalu said the sensitisation had been taken to Holy Ghost motor-park, Garki Market motor-park, New Market motor-park, Abakpa motor-park and Emene motor-park. “We have continued through the ongoing sensitisation to advise commercial drivers to adhere strictly to government orders to checkmate the spread of the Coronavirus. “Whatever order or policy put in place by the government is for the benefit and good of members of the public,’’ he said. According to him, no responsible government will want its citizens to die or be hospitalised unnecessarily. The sector commander said that apart from sensitisation, the FRSC had also joined other security agencies to ensure the implementation of the directive by commercial drivers to the latter. “As it is being observed, majority of the transport companies are already complying with the government order and residents of the state are happy about this,’’ he said.
