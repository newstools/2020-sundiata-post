Liverpool (UK) – Everton and Manchester United drew 1-1 at Goodison Park in the English Premier League (EPL) on Sunday in an enthralling game which ended in VAR drama. A dreadful error from Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea gifted Everton a third-minute opener. The Spaniard dawdled on the ball after a backpass from Harry Maguire and his attempted clearance was charged down by Dominic Calvert-Lewin and flew off the Everton striker into the net. Calvert-Lewin should have doubled the lead shortly afterwards when he broke free of the Manchester United defence, but he shot just wide of De Gea’s right-hand post. Manchester United responded well to the early setback though, with Nemanja Matic hitting the crossbar with a long-range effort. He then forced Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford into a diving save with another well-struck drive. It was January signing Bruno Feranandes who put the visitors level with a superb low shot from outside the penalty box in the 31st minute. Everton’s Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson hit the post with a curling free kick 12 minutes after the interval but Manchester United went close to a winner in the 90th minute. Pickford had to produce a brilliant save with his feet to deny substitute Odion Ighalo. There was VAR drama in stoppage time when Everton thought they had a winner. Calvert-Lewin’s low shot deflected off Harry Maguire and span past Sigurdsson who was lying on the floor in what the video referee ruled was an offside position. (Reuters/NAN
