Nigerian music star, Seyi Shay has weighed in on the Coronavirus stating that the Covid-19 is not as deadly as Malaria and Typhoid. Seyi Shay questioned why the government haven’t done something about malaria and Typhoid that people seem to be getting every week but they are forgetting that for coronavirus. She wrote; So wait… is corona virus more deadly than malaria? And why cant our government do something about malaria and Typhoid that people seem to be getting every week out here? Or is that just a WHOOOOLE ‘nother story?? Ok, so its contagious BUT is it more deadly? This one that everyone is forgetting that people have been and are still dying from Malaria and typhoid… daily! #jedimindgames Why so much hate???
