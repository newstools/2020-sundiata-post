Coker further disclosed that Ogun state has begin mass production of hand sanitizers which would be distribute to over five (05) million citizens and residents of the state free of charge. “But I cannot tell you at this point in time when that one would come up, but I must say the most effective way of preventing COVID-19 is still hand washing with soap and water for 40 to 60 seconds. That’s more effective even than the sanitizers. So, people should wash their hands frequently”. Source
