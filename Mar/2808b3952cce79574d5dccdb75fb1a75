The called on President Buhari to put a stop to flights coming from countries affected by coronavirus. A statement on Tuesday by AIED Director of Media and Publicity, O’Seun John, described the refusal of the president to shut down all entry points as a betrayal of the oath he took to safeguard Nigerians against external and internal forces. “We find it extremely hard to understand the motive behind the refusal of the Buhari administration to close the Nigerian borders and shut down our Airports against travellers from coronavirus infected countries in the wake of the global pandemic. “It is unexplainable that a Father will knowingly and wishfully expose his children to the cold hands of death to satisfy an ego of superiority in the fight against the deadly COVID-19. “Let’s make no mistake, Nigeria is on the brink of an outbreak and like South Korea, who was doing everything right until patient number 31 decided to disobey social distancing order, we can not afford to leave the country to the unseen hands of the divine”, it read. AIED charged Buhari to activate a partial nationwide emergency protocol and have companies direct staff to work remotely. The group warned that the current situation calls for decisive action and that the president should be proactive instead of waiting to send condolence letters.
