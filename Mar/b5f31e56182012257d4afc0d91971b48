Babatunde Fashola, Minister of Works and Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State today adopted a different, yet effective greeting pattern after meeting in Portharcourt, the Rivers State capital today. Instead of the traditional handshake, the two decided to greet each other using the elbow. The move is as a result of advice to avoid shaking of hands following the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.
