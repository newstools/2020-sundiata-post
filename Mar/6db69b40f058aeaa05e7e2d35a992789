The Ghanaian version of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the National Communication Authority (NCA) has begun a nationwide sensitization campaign that will cut across every region of the nation with the message of telecoms consumer education and rights awareness. NCA said the essence of the campaign is amongst other things, to familiarize subscribers with the rights and responsibility charter of the various telecommunication networks in Ghana in order to demand accountability and efficient services from them. Addressing a mammoth crowd of telecoms services subscribers in Accra, the Officer in charge of Information Technology and Regulatory Administration, Mr Smith Quarshie told Ghanaians that consumers according to the NCA have the right to report any service interruptions and malpractices to NCA offices for onward action and solutions from the various network operators across the country. He stressed that consumers could report on issues relating to network porting and SIM fraud and registration among others. NCA further added that many consumers suffer unfair treatment from their telecommunication networks due to the fact that they have little knowledge on their rights and prayed that through the public education many people would become enlightened to demand better service delivery from the mobile networks and encouraged all network users to feel free to walk to their offices anytime they had issues. NCA also used the opportunity to call on all the telecommunication networks to render the appropriate services to their customers in order to pass the quality of service performance report undertaken by the NCA.
