Be friendly in enforcing the lockdown order announced on Sunday by President Muhammadu Buhari. That was the charge of the Lagos state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to security agents on Monday night as lockdown in Lagos commenced 11pm. The Governor called for high professionalism on the part of the enforcement team in dealing with erring persons, cautioning that high-handedness may lead to violation of human rights of residents. Sanwo-Olu gave the charge in a discussion with commanders of all security formations in the State during a Security Council meeting held at the State House in Marina. President Buhari had announced 14-day cessation of movement in Lagos, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Ogun State as part of the steps to break the cycle of the spread of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country. Lagos is the worst hit among the three states locked down by the Federal Government. Source
