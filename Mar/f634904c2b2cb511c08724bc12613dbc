Sex starved female prisoners in Kenya are pleading with authorities to implement new laws that will allow them to have sexual intimacy with their spouses when they visit. Sofia Swaleh who is serving a life sentence, speaking on behalf of her inmates said the time given to their visiting spouses and relatives is too short and does not give room for intimacy. “The Government, through the leadership of Kenyan prisons, should introduce a law that allows women serving lengthy jail terms enjoy sexual intimacy with their visiting husbands,” Swaleh of the Mtangani GK Prison in Malindi, Kilfi County said. Mtangani GK Prison senior administrator, Purity Nkatha Muthaura, spoke with K24 digital, saying the request from the female inmates or even their incarcerated male counterparts cannot be permitted. He added that it will be impossible to allow for such conjugal rights to be enjoyed unless a new law is passed by Parliament. The pursuit to have conjugal visits introduced into the country started years ago. In 2014, similar requests were made but the country’s detention centers were unsuccessful as the Government was not in favour of inmates having conjugal relations because the Government was not ready for such arrangements in the detention facilities.
