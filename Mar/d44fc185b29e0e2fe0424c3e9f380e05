Nigerians have lambasted a former governor of Benue state, George Akume and currently the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs for bowing his head to greet 20 year-old Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels. The incident happened after the former governor met with Regina Danielsâ€™ husband, Ned Okonkwo at an event. Since the photo appeared online, Nigerians have been calling the ex-governor many names for bowing to a little girl. Some wondered what must have made such a respected former governor and senator of a state to bow for Regina Daniels. Many believe Regina Daniels is the one that should have bowed to the former governor and senator because of her age.

The babe has earned it and the fact that Ned in his knowledge and maturity chose her, you must respect her too. Even if you donâ€™t wanna respect her, you cannot disrespect her.
