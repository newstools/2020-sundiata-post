Nigerians have lashed out at Nollywood Actress, Uche Jombo after she revealed that she read an article where it was stated that ”Coronavirus can not survive in a hot environment.” She went ahead to ask Nigerians to read more about the viral disease before the government uses it to ‘‘disappear the newly borrowed money”. Nigerians attacked her for believing that coronavirus cannot survive hot weather. They called her ignorant and dumb. Her tweet reads: Reading up on #CoronavirusOutbreak. We should all collectively do so before the government use this to disappear the newly borrowed money For example: the virus CAN NOT survive in a HOT environment.
