Davido, one of Nigeria’s foremost Afropop singers has said he is not trying to oppress anybody by flaunting the newly acquired private jet by Adedeji Adeleke, his father, on social media. The ‘Omo Baba Olowo (OBO)’ crooner is known for attracting criticisms on social media platforms due to his penchant for flaunting his family’s wealth. Such criticisms, however, thickened recently after he shared photos and a video of his dad’s latest acquisition — a Bombardier Global Express 6000, which is said to be valued at $62 million — on his social media page. “Congrats Daddy on your (our) new baby,” he wrote on Twitter. He also shared a video on his Instagram page, where he appeared to be throwing shades at “bh a** n*s.” Source
