By George Odok Calabar – No fewer than 32 political parties, under the aegis of Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP), on Monday, felicitated the Cross River Governor, Sen. Ben Ayade, on his 52 birthday. The CNPP, in a statement issued by the officials of the 32 political parties, including the Chairman, Mr Sunday Michael, paid glowing tribute to the governor, describing him as a ‘child of promise’ and ‘father of modern Cross River.’ “Blessed be the day that a child of promise was ushered into our world by the host of heavens to shape and reshape events to your glory. “The dexterity with which you have manipulated the wheels of destiny, to ascend the ladder of prominence, even from your widely-known humble beginning, reflects of you, not only an image seemingly invincible, but also a human of outstanding personality,” it remarked. The body noted that Ayade’s sterling performance in office had continued to speak for him and had earned him global recognition, stressing that the world had taken notice of him. “Nigeria and indeed, the world have come to know you as a rare gem, whose intellectual prowess transcends the ordinary, based on the inspiration you continue to dish out to us all. “You have sustained an impeccable track record of service in leadership, as you allow opposition with no issues to rise and have rather turned them to your students, as they have long preoccupied themselves studying your enigmatic and dexterous acts,” CNPP said.
