By Ikenna Osuoha Abuja – Sen. Eze Ajoku, President, Coalition of Societies for the Rights of Old People in Nigeria (COSROPIN) on Wednesday commended the Senate for allowing the Older People’s Rights and Privileges Bill to scale through the second reading. Ajoku told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that the Bill sponsored by Sen. Ezenwa Onyewuchi would help to better the lives of the older people. He lauded Onyewuchi for advancing the course of older people at a very desirable time in the history of Nigeria. “I thanked Sen. Onyewuchi for sponsoring this bill, generations will call you blessed for this bill. “COSROPIN owes you a debt of goodwill and prayers in your career as a politician. “I am personally proud of you as the replacement of my seat in the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” Ajoku said. The COSROPIN boss who congratulated the senators on their courage to set agenda for older people, said that ageing was graceful. He said that older people would continue to work even in retirement for the peaceful coexistence and progress of Nigeria irrespective of their challenges. NAN reports that the Bill which tends to strengthen the protection of the Rights of Older persons was first read in the senate in September 2019. The Bill seeks to identify the peculiar human Rights situation of older persons by reason of age, distinct from other population cohorts. It therefore seeks to commit authorities at all levels of governance to contribute to a positive and healthy societal change that would benefit the elderly. (NAN)
