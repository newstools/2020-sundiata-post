A Nigerian has tested positive for coronavirus in the United States of America, according to reports just coming in from that country. One of the reports, by PMNews, quoted Mayor of Washington D.C. Muriel Bowser as saying a Nigerian who passed through the US capital city has tested positive for coronavirus in neighbouring state of Maryland. “She announced this at a news conference on Saturday night,” the report said on Sunday morning, adding: “She said the Nigerian had visited Washington D.C. and tested positive later in Maryland. All his contacts are being traced in the city. “Bowser had earlier announced that a man in his 50s has tested positive for coronavirus, marking the first presumptively confirmed case in the capital. “She said the man started exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 in late February and was hospitalised Thursday. “President Donald Trump says he isn’t concerned “at all” about the coronavirus getting closer to the White House after the first Washington case and an attendee of a recent political conference where Trump himself had spoken also tested positive for the virus. “Nineteen people have died in the U.S. from the virus. The number of infections in the U.S. is now above 400.”
