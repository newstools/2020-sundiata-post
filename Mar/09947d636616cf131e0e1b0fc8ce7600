The National Executive Council of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) has requested that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) initiate the process of National Right of passage for all technical staff of telecommunications companies in the event of foreseeable lockdown by either the Federal Government or the State Government in an attempt to curb the spread of Coronavirus outbreak in the country. This request is made because of the essential nature of telecommunications infrastructures in managing the entire situation and the need for maintenance and repairs that may arise during the possible lockdown. A statement by ATCON Executive Secretary Ajobola Olude said ATCON counts on NCC to expedite action in this regard while appreciating the Commission for being proactive and attentive. “We also urge all our teeming members and their staff to comply with all the guidelines stipulated by the Federal Ministry of Health and all relevant authorities at State levels”, the statement said.
