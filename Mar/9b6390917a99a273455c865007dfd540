The US death toll from the coronavirus pandemic climbed past 3,000 on Monday, making the outbreak more deadly than the September 11 terrorist attacks that killed 2,977, and health experts are warning the worst is yet to come. Total deaths across the United States increased by at least 605 on Monday, reaching a total of 3,180. It meant someone died every two minutes from the deadly disease.  There were 22,000 new cases which brings the total to 164,471. The amount the daily deaths increases by will continue to rise until the pandemic hits its peak in America which it is still weeks away from. The University of Washington School of Medicine predicts that by April 20, the daily increase of deaths will hit 2,000. They say, by that metric, that the total US death toll will be 82,141. The White House has painted an even bleaker picture; that between 100,000 and 200,000 people die in a best case scenario where people follow social distancing guidelines President Donald Trump yesterday urged Americans to follow the rules. He has extended them to the end of April. New York City is the undoubted epicenter, with 138 new deaths reported on Monday. While it was an increase of 17 percent, it was a smaller increase than Saturday’ spike, when 222 died. While the death rate is slowing, the number of new cases continues to rise. Experts predict the apex will hit in 10 days. Gov. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio are trying now to do everything they can to prepare for the city for that peak. Field hospitals have been set up in Central Park, at the Javits Center and even in hotels like the Plaza and St Regis. There are makeshift morgues popping up outside the city’s overwhelmed hospitals which are struggling to keep up with the body count. dailymail.co.uk
