Manila – A disgruntled former security guard on Monday took an undetermined number of hostages inside a shopping mall in the Philippines, police and local officials said. Hundreds of shoppers and employees were evacuated from the V Mall in the city of Manila’s Greenhills shopping district after gunfire was heard from the second floor, said police spokesman Virgilio Timajo. San Juan City Mayor Francisco Zamora said that based on initial reports, a former security guard who was angry after being let go by the V Mall’s security agency was behind the shooting incident. The guard has allegedly taken hostages, Zamora said. (dpa/NAN)
