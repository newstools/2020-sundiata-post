By Fatima Mohammed-Lawal  Ilorin – Dr Segun Opawoye, a Senior Registrar in the Department of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), has warned youths against use of sex enhancing drugs to impress their partners. Opawoye gave the advice while speaking with newsmen on Monday in Ilorin. The medical expert also warned youths against illicit sexual activities because of their destructive effects on lives and careers. According to him, evidence shows that some sudden deaths, particularly among youths and the aged in recent times, are results of effects of the consumption of illicit sexual enhancement pills. He said that available information suggested that males and females were showing heavy reliance on sex drugs. “The practice is common among males who are always out to impress their illicit sexual partners. “Most drugs in use have negative effects on the liver, kidney and other sensitive organs of the body, which are always left weaker and destroyed by toxic effects,” he said. The health expert further said that evidences abound to show that such drugs could lead to mental degradation and irreversible erectile dysfunction among long time users. He decried increasing rate of sexual pervasion among youths, saying many promising lives had been destroyed following heavy reliance on sex enhancing drugs. Opawoye noted that illicit sexual practices had resulted in the spread of venereal diseases, unwanted pregnancies and untimely deaths in the course of illegal abortion. He also warned youths to desist from masturbation, saying the practice was not only unhealthy but could also have negative effects on their marital life when eventually married. Opawoye encouraged youths to stay away from sex until they were ready for it through marriage as that was the only platform allowed by culture and religion. He appealed to all stakeholders to join forces in eradicating sexual perversion in the society. (NAN)
