According to AFP, the US has approved the anti-malarial drug chloroquine for use as a treatment against the new coronavirus. The approval was given by President Donald Trump on Thursday. “We’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately, and that’s where the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has been so great,” Trump told reporters. “They’ve gone through the approval process – it’s been approved. They took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription.”
