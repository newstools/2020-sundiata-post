South African rapper AKA suffered a fall when the crowd he jumped into failed to catch him during a performance. Concert attendees were enjoying the performance when the rapper jumped into the crowd in an attempt to â€˜crowd-surfâ€™, but the group he flew into moved away and he landed on the ground. Some of the concert goers filmed the incident and it has gone â€˜platinum viralâ€™ in the South African social media space. After the fall, 32-year-old Kiernan Forbes, fondly known as â€˜AKAâ€™, continued to perform while laying on the ground.
