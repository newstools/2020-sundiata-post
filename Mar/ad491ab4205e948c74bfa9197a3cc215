The statement reads: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: SUSPENSION OF THE ON-GOING ORIENTATION COURSE Sequel to the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic which led to the cancellation of the National Sports Festival, Management of the National Youth Service Corps Scheme wishes to announce the suspension of the on-going Orientation Course for the 2020 Batch “A” Stream 1 Corps Members.
