The Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Ibrahim Ali Pantami, has charged regulatory parastatals, private regulators under the Ministry, and other key stakeholders to come up with an effective subsidiary regulation for the country’s telecommunication industry. He said the regulation will not only help to transform Nigeria’s telecom sector, but also fast-track its development for socio-economic growth. Dr. Pantami, spoke on Tuesday at the ‘Stakeholders Consultative Forum on Guidelines for The Use of Television White Space (TVWS) in Nigeria,’ held at the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) Headquarters in Abuja. The Forum was jointly organized by NCC and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC). According to the Minister, the joint effort of NCC and NBC will definitely support the eight pillars of digital economy and strategy, most especially pillar 1, which is centred on developmental regulation, and pillar 3, which is on solid infrastructure. He noted that the strategic engagement is coming at the right time, while also commending both NCC and NBC for complying with the rule-making process. In his remark, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman/CEO of NCC, said the gathering was convened to discuss the use of TVWS in Nigeria, and also aimed at finalizing the draft guidelines on the deployment of the technology. “The Commission has remained resolute in efforts towards bridging the digital divide between strata of our society. To this end, it had over years, evolved initiatives not only aimed at increasing broadband penetration, but also promoting connectivity to the rural areas,” he added. Source: newsdigest.ng
