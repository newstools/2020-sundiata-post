Controversial ex-BBNaija reality star, Ifu Ennada has supported a controversial opinion expressed by a Nollywood actress, Susan Peters, who had some days ago advocated for women to be allowed to marry more than one husband. The reality star took to her Instastory to express her desire to marry three husbands and wrote: “I think I want to marry 3 husbands …. The way its doing me now. Just thinking out loud shaa” She however, didn’t elaborate more like Peters who had stated her reason being that women should be allowed to marry two husbands in case something bad happens to one.
