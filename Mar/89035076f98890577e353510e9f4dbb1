Rabiu Kwankwaso, a former Governor of Kano state has accused President Buhari of ordering the dethronement of Muhammad Sanusi lI as the Emir of Kano. Recall that Sanusi was deposed as the Kano emir by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje on Monday and subsequently banished to Nasarawa state. Kwankwaso who appointed Sanusi as the 14th Emir of Kano in 2014 when he was governor of the state told BBC Hausa on Wednesday that “Kano state government officials have been saying they were directed to dethrone Mr Sanusi ll. He (Buhari) instructed them.” He alleged that contrary to claims that Mr Buhari had intervened in the Kano emirate crisis, “we believe here in Kano that he (Buhari) interferes where he wishes.” The former governor also said President Buhari “doesn’t interfere where his intervention is needed, but interferes on issues he is supposed to be neutral about.” Mr Kwankwaso described the removal of Sanusi as a sad incident to Kano, Nigeria and the entire world, adding that “the emir (Sanusi) is a global citizen.” Source
