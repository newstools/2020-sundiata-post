The US government is expanding its European travel ban to include Britain and Ireland, as it seeks to contain the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe. Donald Trump originally exempted Britain and Ireland from his 30-day ban on travellers from 26 European countries that took effect at midnight on Friday. The new travel restrictions on Britain and Ireland will go into effect on Monday evening at midnight, US vice-president Mike Pence said in a White House press conference. More than 1,000 people in Britain have tested positive for the virus and more than 20 of those have died. A number of the latest patients who died – who were over 60 with the oldest in his 90s – had underlying health conditions, NHS England said. Independent.co.uk
