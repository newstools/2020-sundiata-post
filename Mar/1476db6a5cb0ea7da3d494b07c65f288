Maritime Safety Education and Administration who were on oversight visit to the
Agency in Lagos. The statement reads in full: Dear Colleagues, this is to inform you that on Tuesday 3rd
March 2020, the  Director General of the
Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku
Peterside led other Management staff of the Agency to receive members of the
House Committee on Maritime Safety Education and Administration who were on
oversight visit to the Agency in Lagos. This was the reason the DG could not personally be in Abuja
to honor the invitation by the National Assembly joint committee investigating
activities of foreign vessel owners in the country. It is noteworthy that due to the clash of both schedules,
NIMASA Management communicated same to the National Assembly joint committee
investigating activities of foreign vessel owners in the country requesting for
a change of date. However, a member of the Executive Management, the Executive
Director Maritime Labour and Cabotage services Mr Gambo Ahmed led the high
powered team to represent the Agency. NIMASA Management respects the National Assembly and will
always respond to invitation from them. Please kindly help use, as our position on the story making
the rounds on his absence. Many thanks Isichei Osamgbi Head Public Relations, NIMASA
