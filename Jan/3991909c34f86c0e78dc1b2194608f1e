By Olawale Akinremi Ibadan – Alhaji Mukaila Eniola, the father in-law to one Kafayat Eniola, on Friday told a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan that his son, Saheed, lied against his wife that his younger brother was caught having sex with her. He told the court that such a thing was only an excuse by Saheed because it never happened. Kafayat, had on Nov. 27, 2019 filed a divorce suit against her husband, citing his gross irresponsibility and carefree attitude to her and their two children. She also stated that her husband had abandoned her for 12 years to resettle with another woman. Saheed, who consented to the suit, said that his father had on several occasions caught his wife having sex with his younger brother, Jelili, when he was not at home. He also doubted whether the two children produced by his wife belonged to him. Against this background, the court summoned Saheed’s father to clear the air on the allegations leveled by Saheed against his wife. But Saheed’s father, in a message sent through the court’s bailiff, said that there was never a time he told Saheed that he caught Kafayat in an amorous relationship with her husband’s younger brother. “Even if I caught Kafayat and her husband’s younger brother sleeping with each other, how would I have gone ahead to tell Saheed, do I want to destroy my own family? “Saheed is a big liar, I never mentioned anything like that,” Saheed’s father said. In his judgment, the court’s President, Chief Ademola Odunade, dissolved the marriage and granted custody of the two children to Kafayat. Odunade directed the defendant to pay N10,000 as the children’s monthly feeding allowance in addition to being responsible for their education and other welfare needs. (NAN)
