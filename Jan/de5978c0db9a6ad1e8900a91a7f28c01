Lusaka – The Zambian government is keen to see increased trade and investment ties with the UK, a senior government official said on Monday. Paul Mihova, Zambia’s newly-appointed high commissioner to UK, said there are many opportunities to increase trade and investment between the two countries because of the warm relations that have existed over the years. “We want to see more trade between Zambia and British businesses because opportunities are plenty and we want to turn these opportunities into sustained growth,’’ he said in a statement. According to him, Zambia and the UK have strong historical ties as evidenced by some of the UK investments existing in Zambia. (Xinhua/NAN)
