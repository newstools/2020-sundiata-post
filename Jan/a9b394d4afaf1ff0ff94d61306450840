By Muftau Ogunyemi Abuja (Sundiata Post) – An NGO, Foundation for Families of Fallen Servicemen, has appealed to all the 36 state  governors in the country to declare free education for the children of fallen servicemen. The
chairman of the foundation, Mr Alex Ojo, made the appeal in a statement made
available to newsmen on Monday in Akure. He said
that such a gesture would go a long way to relief the widows and the families
left behind by the nation’s fallen heroes. “We are
appealing to the state governors across the country to use the occasion of the
forthcoming Armed Forces Remembrance Day to declare free education for the
children of our fallen servicemen. “As
Nigeria celebrates another Armed Forces Remembrance Day on Jan. 15, 2020,
declaring free education for the children of the past heroes will go a long way
to encourage and boost the morale of security operatives and members of the
armed forces who give their all to defend the country at the front lines. “Adequate
support is very imperative for the families of the fallen servicemen at this
peculiar time in our history as a nation,” he said. The
chairman explained that the foundation was founded to support the wives and the
children of men and officers who died in the line of duty in the country. He said
that the NGO had been involved in facilitating free education, free health
services, housing, and economic empowerment for dependents of soldiers and
other security operatives in the country. NAN
