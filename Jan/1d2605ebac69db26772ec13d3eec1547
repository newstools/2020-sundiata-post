Phnom Penh –  Cambodia’s Ministry of Environment has released measures to prevent and reduce air pollution in the kingdom after it observed that air quality had declined. The ministry said in a statement on Friday that it had equipped air quality monitoring devices across the country. It stated the devices would help to detect PM10 and PM2.5 (air particles) and found that air quality is on the decline that could affect human health. “PM10 and PM2.5 are produced by factories, diesel driven vehicles, forest fire, rubbish and solid waste burning at construction sites, public areas and rubbish dumps. “ PM10 and PM2.5 have recently increased higher than a standard limit,” it stated. The ministry advised the sub-national administrations and environment departments across the country to take action to prevent forest fire, garbage and solid waste burning at public areas and rubbish dumps. It said that the advice would help to improve air quality in cities and provinces. “Action must also be taken to prevent dust from construction sites, infrastructure renovation sites and roads,’’ it stated. It also called on people not to burn rubbish, solid waste, and agricultural waste as well as other chemical waste. According to experts, 70 per cent of air pollution came from vehicle fuels, 20 per cent from dust at construction sites and 10 per cent from other sources such as rubbish burning. (Xinhua/NAN)
