By Fatima Mohammed-Lawal Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Dr Abiodun Ajijolakewu, Lecturer at the Department of
Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Ilorin, has invented a
‘Double Decker Dual Mode Temperature Controlled Incubator Shaker’. This is
contained in the University of Ilorin Bulletin, issued on Monday. The
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the machine was designed to add more
value to research endeavours. NAN
also reports that the machine is programmed to mix substances and maintain
different temperature within the same machine. According
to Ajijolakewu, the machine is the first of its kind in the country. He
explained that the machine has the capacity to separate different functions at
the same time, while it also saves time, money and space. “The
usual tradition is that we get the material that can maintain temperature and
agitation at the same time. “The
double decker dual mode temperature controlled incubator shaker can have
temperature 35 degree for one, 23 degree at the other one and 32 degree on the
other hand and all are going on at the same time,” he said. Ajijolakewu
said the machine would be useful for all Departments under the Faculty of Life
Sciences, as well as others like Clinical Sciences, adding that its application
will aid good researches in the University. He
recommended the machine for Universities and the Federal Government, as it
makes research less laborious, explaining that the derivable benefits of the
machine are enormous. Ajijolakewu
also appealed to the Federal Government to provide academic and research
materials and support for tertiary institutions in the country, especially the
universities, by way of improving laboratories for the attainment of good
output He
implored lecturers to always try to subscribe to reputable international
journals that will lead them to see methods others adopt in inventing their
technology, in order to replicate such scientific heights in the country. (NAN)
