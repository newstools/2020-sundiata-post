Ali Arouzi reports Iran state media is claiming to have killed 30 troops, though Arouzi noted that the report has not been confirmed and CNN is reporting that the casualties were Iraqi soldiers, not Americans. He said “Iran is all in right now” and “all bets are off.” “If the U.S. retaliates, this is going to blow up beyond any imagination,” he Arouzi warned. US President Donald Trump had warned that there would be severe consequences should Iran attack America in retaliation for the US killing of Iranian military commander, Qassem Suleimani. (News Agency)
