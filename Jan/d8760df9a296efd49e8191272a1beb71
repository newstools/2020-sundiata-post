By Sani Abdulrahman Kaduna – The Police Officers Wives Association (POWA) Kaduna chapter on Saturday, distributed startup and food items to 1,700 widows whose husbands died in active service. The items and materials distributed on the occasion included bags of rice, cartons of noodles, cooking oil, wrappers, sewing machines, popcorn machines, make up kits and cake baking machines. The items were distributed to the widows who completed skills acquisition training on various handcrafts. The Chairperson of POWA in the state, Dr Habiba Janga, who distributed the items to the beneficiaries, encouraged them to also transfer the kills acquired to other widows who were not opportune to be part of the programme. Janga said that the food items were made available through the contributions of the police officers in active service and other philanthropists. She called on the wealthy individuals in the state to always support the less privileged. Janga said that reaching out to people in distress no matter how small would go a long way in salvaging unpleasant situations. She also appealed to the state government to provide succor to the large number of widows in the state. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Ali Janga, said the programme was meant to support widows of the deceased police officers. He assured the widows that the command was committed to ensuring that they receive support to improve their livelihood. The Kaduna State Commissioner of Human Services and Social Development, Mrs Hafsa Baba, thanked POWA for initiating the empowerment programme. She restated the state government’s commitment in impacting positively on the lives of widows and less privileged. The commissioner assured that the government was open to supporting the association in its programmes. (NAN)
