Sure former president Olusegun Obasanjo knows how to kill the swag. The president who is always in the news for the right reasons wonâ€™t stop to amaze Nigerians. If Obasanjo is not writing the letter he would be giving out some inspirational talks. This dressing of the former president has gotten everyone talking on social media. With a t-shirt and a matching face cap worn on a jean, the president is simply the best fashionista amongst all our former heads of state. And take note it is rare we get to see the former head of state and president of the federal republic of Nigeria putting on English attire. So when you see Baba Iyabo dressed to kill then know that there is trouble. The squirrel does not run in the day time, it is either something is pursuing it or it is pursuing something.
