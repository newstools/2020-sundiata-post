Two suspected thieves were burnt to death by an angry mob in Bayelsa. The two armed robbery suspects allegedly specialised in robbing Points of Sales (POS) business outlets in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. The men, who were in a Lexus SUV, reportedly stormed a POS-enabled cash centre at Green Villa in Biogbolo suburb of Yenagoa on Thursday, January 23. They attempted to rob customers trying to deposit their money but the POS attendant raised alarm and the men were caught by passersby, beaten, butchered and burnt by the irate mob that gathered. Their get-away car was also burnt. The police in the state have condemned the mob action leading to the deaths of the two suspects. Commissioner of Police in the state, Uche Anozia, has ordered an investigation and said that those responsible for the act will be arrested and prosecuted. Source
