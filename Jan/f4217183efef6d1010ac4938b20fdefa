I can’t even make transfer.” Another user tweeted “GT bank why are you people telling me no account was found with my number, tell me what kind of thunder you want? Cooked or per boiled? Because I need to make transfer and it’s not working. Another user said, “Dear @gtbank @gtbank_help, your customer care numbers are not going through, I can’t login to my mobile banking app, can’t transact with 737 and I can’t make withdrawals, what’s going on? David Seun Oguniyi, a GT bank user, said “All gtbank transaction and payment channels not going through seems some network downtime. But wondering why they aren’t saying anything about what’s happening or even when services will be restored. I have much more expectations than this from GT.”
