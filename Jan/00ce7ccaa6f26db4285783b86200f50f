Cairo – Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Gheit, on Wednesday said U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for the Middle East was a great violation of the legitimate rights of Palestinians. The League disclosed this in a statement in Cairo. Gheit said that any serious plan to achieve peace must meet the expectations of both parties. “A just and sustainable peace cannot be achieved while ignoring the reality of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories since 1967,” he said. The Foreign Ministers of Arab League member states will hold an extraordinary meeting on Saturday to discuss Trump’s plan. This was in reaction to Trump’s comment after unveiling his plan for the Middle East, which would give Israel control over Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the strategic Jordan Valley. Meanwhile, Palestinians rejected the proposal, which significantly differs from the 1967 borders that had previously been the basis for peace plans. According to Qatar’s official news agency, Qatar is ready to accept all efforts geared toward longstanding peace in the occupied Palestinian territories. The SPA News Agency reported that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, reiterated in a phone call with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas his country’s support for Palestinian rights. (dpa/NAN)
