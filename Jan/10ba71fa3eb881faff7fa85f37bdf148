A Kenyan woman, Edna Mukwana has shocked many Kenyans for selling her husband for Ksh 1700 – which is N6,000 – to buy new year clothes for her children. The Kakamega woman, Edna Mukwana who claims her husband is yet to return home seven days after she confronted him with another woman in their matrimonial bed, has narrated of her marriage woes. She said; “My husband is married to alcohol and whoring around. I told the woman who has been misleading him to send me Ksh 2000 but she sent me Ksh 1700 instead. I have used all the money to buy new year clothes for my children” When asked if she will change her mind and welcome her husband again Edna said; “I can’t. I don’t want to get into the new year with the 2019 nuisance”
