By Leonard Okachie Umuahia – Mr Pius Obi, the proprietor of Pius Comprehensive Secondary School, Umuahia in Abia, has urged relevant stakeholders to organise special training on teaching skills for non-education corps members posted to teach during the one year national service. Obi made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Umuahia on Monday. He said that such training would mitigate the challenges of unqualified teachers rocking the education sector. The proprietor, who was honoured recently as the Best Corps Employer in Umuahia South council area by the National Youth Service Cops (NYSC), appealed to school administrators to train and retrain the corps members to make them more relevant to the system. “In as much as we are not comfortable with the trend of non-education corps members as teachers, we have our own internal arrangement where we hold workshop and train them. “We train them on how to prepare lesson notes as well as running of the internal affairs of the system. “Teaching is a profession just like Medicine and Law, that is why it should be for those that have the entry knowledge,” he said. Obi, who employed some corps members that served in his school, noted that he had always encouraged those posted to his school by giving them supports, promising to sustain the tempo. He commended the NYSC for the initiative, and urged the authorities to always consider graduates that studied education first during such postings to schools. (NAN)
