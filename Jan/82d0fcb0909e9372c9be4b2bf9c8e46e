By Monday Ajogun Benin – Edo’s Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, on Wednesday assured that the newly-laid tartan tracks of the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin are of international standard. Shaibu spoke shortly after he was conducted round by Femi James, Project Manager of Peculiar Ultimate Consult, the contractors handling ongoing reconstruction work at the stadium. He said the tracks could host any track and field events of Olympic and world standards. “The aspect they (the contractors) are in laying the tartan tracks is the most difficult part of the work, because we want to have not just a standard tartan tracks but international tartan
tracks that can host any Olympic event. “What we have presently is more of the base for the tartan tracks, but with the level they have gone you can see that within seven or eight days the tracks will be ready to host races. “What is critical here is the measurement and the instrument that they are using is of the international standard. They are to make sure that everything is done according to the proscribed measurement. “This is the most difficult part of the tartan tracks, and the other one is to give it colour. This part is the base and it’s very critical,’’ the deputy governor, who is Chairman of the Local
Organising Committee (LOC) for the 2020 National Sports Festival (NSF), said. He however pointed out that the quality of work was commendable, saying the state government had insisted that the contractor takes the responsibility for every mistake if their is any. Shaibu said the state government would be enjoying a 20-year guaranty on the reconstruction work because the manufacturers of all the equipment were the ones installing them. (NAN)
