The corpse of Mrs. Onyemata, mother of a Catholic priest of the Okigwe Catholic Diocese, Rev. Fr. Alex Onyemata got razed by fire over the weekend. The ambulance was on its way to the Mercy Mortuary in Umulogho Obowo, Imo State on Saturday, January 11, 2020, when it caught fire along Owerri-Umuahia road, due to a petrol leakage. The corpse was, however, quickly rescued by her family members who were accompanying, before the fire engulfed the vehicle. It was further gathered that as they made efforts to quench the fire, the fuel was still dropping more from the fuel thank with fire at the same time, indicating that the fire was already burning inside the fuel tank.
