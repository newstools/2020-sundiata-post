By Mercy Omoike Lagos – All Progressives Congress Chieftain Moshood Salvador says Nigeria must recognise the place of the youth in leadership now to be able to secure the future. Salvador told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Tuesday that the country must begin to equip the youth with the right training to take over leadership. “Refusing to recognise the place of the youth is working to an end; any house that refuses to give good training to the younger ones will fail. “The future of the country is in the hands of the youth; we must take it very serious now. “We must groom the youth properly politically; before we can do that, we must shun money politics,’’ he told NAN. According to him, it is the youth who determine the victory of any political party or candidate. “It will be my responsibility to speak to youth organisations to let the youth know that the future lies in their hands,” Salvador said. On rotational presidency, Salvador said that it was in line with the federal character principle. “In every law, there is an intention; the intent of federal character is to carry everybody along,’’ he said. He drummed support for rotational presidency in 2023. “When you speak of the feasibility of rotational presidency, the question to ask is: Are we interested in the progress of democracy? “If we believe in democracy, then we have to support rotational presidency to cut across all the geopolitical zones,” he said.
