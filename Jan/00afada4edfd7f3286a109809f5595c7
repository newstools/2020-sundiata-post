Multi-award winning artiste, Davido recently revealed that he saved his fiancee, Chioma Avril Rowland’s name as “Sweet In The Middle” on his phone. The singer made this known on his social media account, perhaps to publicize his hit track which is also titled, “Sweet In The Middle” featuring Wurld, Naira Marley and Zlatan Ibile. We recall the singer and his girlfriend sparked breakup rumours after both unfollowed each other on IG, Instagram. Moments later, a quick check showed they followed each other again.
