The judge said, “you ruined this child by raping her over and over again.” In his defence, his lawyer read a 2016 letter Minaj wrote in a bid to reduce his time behind bars, calling him the most patient, gentle, genuine, giving selfless Man. The accused pleaded for ‘mercy’ stating that he would like to apologize for the pain that he caused. He equally claimed he had an excessive drinking problem. The Judge who did not take his plea sentenced him to 25 years in prison, two years after a jury handed down the guilty verdict for the sexual abuse case which began in 2015. Source
