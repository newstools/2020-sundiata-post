The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has threatened to sanction any police commander who compromised discipline or violated the rights of the citizens. He noted the rise in cases of incivility to citizens, misuse of firearms, deployment of personnel on unauthorised duties and illegal checkpoints against extant directives, noting that the commanders would be held liable for the infractions by their men. Addressing the commanders in charge of the Police Mobile Force, Special Protection Unit and the Counter-Terrorism Unit at the force headquarters, Abuja, on Wednesday, the IG asked them to focus on their primary duty of protecting lives and property and to ensure compliance with Force Orders and directives. He drew the officers’ attention to the recent admonition by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in which he said the police would not only be judged by the number of crimes they had busted but the extent to which they conformed to professional and legal standards. Adamu stated, “In line with this presidential warning, I charge you to return to your bases with a new orientation and firm determination to demonstrate competent and firm leadership that will not only sustain your profile as courageous and professional commanders but as one that will never compromise discipline and respect for the rights of citizens.” Doing otherwise, Adamu noted, would henceforth attract stern disciplinary actions against the commanders, including removal for lacking professional leadership and competency. Meanwhile, the IG has decorated 40 Deputy Commissioners of Police promoted to Commissioner of Police by the Police Service Commission. He disclosed that 10,114 officers had been promoted on merit since January 2019 to date. The police boss enjoined the men to demonstrate sound professional judgment in all their decisions “knowing that you could be called to account for your actions and inactions.”
