Meanwhile, reactions and tributes have continued to pour in for the legend. Longtime teammate between 1996 and 2004 Shaquille O’Neal said that words could not express the pain he was going through over the loss of Bryant and his daughter. Deron Williams, who won an Olympic gold alongside Bryant, said he was lost for words. He described Bryant as “the greatest competitor I have ever gone up against and played with.” U.S. President Donald Trump who described Kobe’s death as a terrible news, tweeted: “He loved his family so much, and had such strong passion for the future. The loss of his beautiful daughter, Gianna, makes this moment even more devastating.” NBA pays tribute to Kobe below: Source
