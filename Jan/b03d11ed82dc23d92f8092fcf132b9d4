Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kano State chapter, Alhaji Rabiu Bichi, has dumped the party to join the All Progressive Congress (APC). The development is the latest crack in the Kwankwasiyya movement following the exit of the former deputy governor, Hafiz Abubakar; former managing director of Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Aminu Dabo, among others in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. Alhaji Bichi served as Secretary to the State Government (SSG) during former governor, Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso’s administration between 2011 and 2015. A reliable source added that hundreds of Kwankwaso’s loyalists defected with Bichi to the ruling party in the state. Although there is no official confirmation from former SSG, a source close to him said he took the decision to leave the party long before the judgement of the Supreme Court. The source also disclosed that the decision of Bichi was not related to the outcome of the Supreme Court judgement. The source who craved anonymity said: “It was purely based on principles and personal conviction.” Recall that the Supreme Court last Monday affirmed Abdullahi Ganduje’s victory as the duly elected governor of the state.(Tribune).
