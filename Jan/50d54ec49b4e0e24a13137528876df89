By Polycarp Auta Jos – Rev. Fr. Kizito Fogos, the Parish Priest of Church of Assumption, Chongo’Pyeng, Jos, has urged Christians in Nigeria to submit themselves in true and total repentance to God. Fogos gave the advice in his sermon on Sunday in Jos, and decried that most Christians had derailed from God’s presence and had embraced evil. According to him, the lack of repentance had led to the disunity and confusion currently ongoing among Christians in the country. He said that most Christians were mere church goers, noting that they don’t give room for the word of God to permeate through their hearts. “One of the greatest challenges of the church today is that majority of Christians have not totally submitted themselves to God in true repentance. “This is why we have division among the Christians in Nigeria; this is why a lot of things are going wrong even in the country “A repentant Christian will not speak ill, scorn or vilify a follow Christian or even a fellow human being. “If we adhere strictly to the teachings of the Bible, Nigeria will experience peace, the killing and maiming and all the evil things will stop. “So, today, St Paul in our second reading is pleading with us to do away with evil, repent and embrace God,” he said The Cleric advised christians to constantly study the Bible, insisting that it remained the most richest and valuable books on earth. “We can truly repent only when we constantly study the word of God. So, I urge you all to make it a point of duty to study the Bible and be enriched with wisdom,” he urged. (NAN)
