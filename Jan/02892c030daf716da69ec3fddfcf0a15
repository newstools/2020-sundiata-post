Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Governors Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa) and Bello Matawalle (Zamfara) are among the party chieftains now at the ongoing meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja. The meeting comes in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment which voided the election of Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP as the governor of Imo State. However, the majority of the governors elected under the party are however absent. The meeting is expected to decide on further action on the apex court ruling, which has already been denounced by the main opposition party. Details later
