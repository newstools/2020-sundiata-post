Bauchi State Police Command has apprehended a man, Solomon Peters, who allegedly stabbed his girlfriend, Patience Zakari, to death in Bauchi following a disagreement over telephone call. . Peters took to his heels after committing the heinous crime in the early hours of Friday but was arrested on Sunday. The deceased was a National Diploma (ND) graduate from the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi. A telephone call from another male friend of the deceased had resulted in a heated argument, resulting in violent scuffle that led to jealous Peters stabbing Patience with a knife. A source narrated how the deceased briefed him of the incident before she finally died. He said the lovers had a heated argument when the deceased received a phone call from a male friend in the middle of the night. “She narrated to me before she died that everything happened at about 1:30 a.m. on Friday morning. She said she received a phone call from just an ordinary male friend and her Solomon got jealous and started harassing her verbally. . As she was trying to explain to him, he pounced on her and started hitting her. She took a bottle, hit him on the head in self defense because the beating was too much for her and the man picked up a knife and stabbed her in the back in retaliation. . She said she lost a lot of blood before she was rushed to a clinic in the morning where she was treated and brought back home in the evening when she narrated the incident to me. Unfortunately, when I left the place, I heard that the wound degenerated and she was rushed to a hospital later that night where she eventually gave up,” the source explained. Source
