By George Odok Calabar – Mr Eteng Jonah-Williams, Speaker, Cross Rivers House of Assembly says the house is not investigating PZ Wilmar Company or any of its subsidiaries. Jonah-Williams said this is a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr Hope Obeten which was made available to newsmen in Calabar on Friday. He said the assembly had not received any official complaint from the host communities against the company or any of its subsidiaries. “The assembly’s attention has been drawn to media reports claiming that it is investigating PZ Wilmar and its subsidiary, Biase Plantations Limited. “The assembly has no official correspondence from the host communities on the said matter. Therefore, such publication is unsubstantiated, misleading and defamatory,” he said. The speaker said that the assembly’s committee on Agriculture only visited the company and its host communities as part of its oversight functions. He stated that PZ Wilmar and its subsidiaries, Biase Plantations Limited and Eyop Industries Limited were responsible corporate entities operating in the state. “They are fully operating within the extant laws of the state in undertaking their businesses as major processor and merchandiser of palm oil. “The publication portraying the company as being investigated by the assembly is full of fabrication and inaccuracies. “ The assembly is however constrained to respond because of the implications of this publication to its integrity,” he said. Jonah-Williams said the current administration was committed to stimulating the state’s economy through industrialization and development of agriculture. (NAN)
