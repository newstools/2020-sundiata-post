Ciera Ross, a mother of two, has been arrested and charged with raping a man. According to CBS Chicago, Ross and a friend were driving on the North Side of Chicago when they saw a man walking down the street in late December. Ross, 25, stopped and asked the 33-year-old man if he wanted a ride. The man took the offer, but Ross’ true intentions became evident when she pulled a gun on the man. She forced the man to go to the backseat and told him to have intercourse with her friend. The man pleaded for the women to stop after they made him handle the woman’s bre@sts and butt. Ross then ordered the man to take his clothes off and her friend began to assault him sèxually. The women also took $200 and credit cards from the man. The male victim was able to escape when he saw a taxi cab and ran from the car naked. The cab driver allowed the man to use his cellphone to take a picture of Ross’ license plate. Chicago police arrested Ross on jan. 3 and the victim identified her as the assailant. Ross has been arrested for prostitution in the past. She was charged with rape and armed robbery and held on a $75,000 bond. Her friend has yet to be charged.
