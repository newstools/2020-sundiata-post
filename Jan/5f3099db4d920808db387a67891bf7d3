When the spiritual director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Revd. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, prophesied that the All Progressives Congress governorship candidate at the March 9, 2019, governorship election in Imo state, Senator Hope Uzodinma, would become the governor of the state this year, followers of Gov Emeka Ihedioha poured insults on him. The cleric was quoted as saying, “I don’t know the manner the revelation will manifest but no prophecy has ever been declared on this prayer ground without coming to pass. In spite of all that would happen this 2020, there is hope. In Imo State, there is hope. Hope, hope, hope. Hope in Imo State. Imo people have suffered but God is raising a new hope that would be an agent of salvation for them. “He is coming with a new flag to restore the dignity of that noble land. New leadership will break barriers and there would be joy in the land of Imo. Lift your candles as I bless Hope Uzodinma and I empower him spiritually to take over. How, I do not know.” Even the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) distanced itself from the prophesy. According to CAN’s leader, Senior Apostle Godson Ibeji, the cleric’s prophesy is without substance, wondering why a matter before the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, would be so tossed around. He said that said CAN had consistently kicked against such prophecies tailored to suit certain politicians. Today, however, Rev Mbaka has the final laugh. Despite the knocks that hit him, the man of God didn’t panic nor swallow his words. The Supreme Court today sacked Ihedioha, declaring Senator Uzodimma as governor of Imo State. The seven-member panel of justices today held that Emeka Ihedioha was not duly elected Governor.
