Premier League managers have written to FIFA, asking for the controversial handball rule to change, the UK Mirror reports. The new ruling states that any contact between hand and the ball in an attacking phase of play, is deemed to be an offence. This has led to a number of goals being disallowed after VAR reviews, despite obvious non-intentional contact. West Ham midfielder, Declan Rice, was harshly penalised during his side’s defeat to Sheffield United last week. Wolves also saw Pedro Neto’s goal against Manchester United in the FA Cup ruled out, after the ball struck Raul Jimenez in the build-up. The League Managers’ Association (LMA) has written to FIFA, listing instances where goals have been harshly ruled out after VAR intervention. Wolves boss, Nuno Espirito Santo, led the calls for the review of the current ruling. “The handball rule is going to be reviewed that’s for sure. Managers, players, fans have all seen that it’s not okay. The message is so clear and so loud about the handball rule. “The fans are the most important people in all this and the fans aren’t happy. That’s a bad sign,” Santo said.
