By Oladele Eniola Lagos – Mr Yomi Davids, Coordinator, Centre for Youths Integrated Development (CYID), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), has advised youths in the country to acquire skills to reduce the rate of unemployment. Davids, who said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Lagos, explained that acquiring skills was necessary to reduce the rate of unemployment in the country. According to him, skill acquisition has become more important due to the high rate of unemployment in the country. “Unemployment is becoming a cankerworm that is eating deep into the fabrics of the society. It has been regarded as a major development challenge, with implication on economic welfare, social stability and human dignity. “We cannot keep on relying on government to do everything. So it is important that skills are acquired to serve as empowerment. “The importance of skill acquisition cannot be overemphasised, as it will enrich lives in various ways,” he said. Davids disclosed that the NGO would empower 150 youths across the state and also help them set up their various businesses. “We want to ensure that most of our youths are empowered with different skills and we are breaking out of the norm by sponsoring them in whatever businesses they decide to undertake. “Various enlightenment and awareness programmes will also be carried out to enlighten the public about the dangers of drug abuse among youths. “Our aim is to sensitise our youths and ensure that they are put on the right path so that they can become useful to themselves and the society,” he said. He advised Nigerians to be focused in achieving their goals, noting that distractions should be avoided. (NAN)
