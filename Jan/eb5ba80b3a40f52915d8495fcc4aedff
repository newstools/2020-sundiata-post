AWKA – The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has called on Senator Hope Uzodimma, the Supreme Court-installed Governor of Imo State to vacate Douglas House, the Imo State Government House immediately insisting that he did not win the governorship election held last year. The group said, on Saturday, that election is not rocket science for a person that came fourth to suddenly become the first. The Supreme Court had, on Tuesday, nullified the election of Hon. Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as governor of the state and declared Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as the winner the March 9, 2019 governorship election. According to the unanimous judgement read by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, the apex court ruled that results in 388 polling units were unlawfully excluded in the course of collation of the final election result in the state. Kekere-Ekun said that with the addition of the results, Uzodinma polled a majority of the votes cast and ought to have been declared the winner of the said election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Confirming an earlier protest held yesterday (Saturday), by IPOB members in Imo State, the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Comrade Emma Powerful, said that the protest was a way of calling the government to order. He described the Supreme Court ruling that declared Uzodinma as a kangaroo judgement. Comrade Powerful said: “We cannot accept a judgement that declared a fourth position winner of an election. That judgement is a kangaroo judgement and Imo people will not accept it. “Imo State is our land, it’s a Biafra land. We don’t want Hausa/Fulani government here. They should leave our land alone for us. “If they don’t want Ihedioha as the governor of the state, then they should call for a fresh election, rather than using the court to hijack governance.” •News Express
