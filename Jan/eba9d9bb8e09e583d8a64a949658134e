Prince Harry and Meghan London – Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, were back in Britain on Tuesday after a six-week private visit to Canada. One of their first official engagements on British soil was a visit to Canada House at Trafalgar Square, where they extended their thanks to High Commissioner Janice Charette and her staff for the hospitality they received in Canada. The two spent Christmas in Canada with their baby son, Archie, along with Meghan’s mother. The couple were seen jogging and hiking during their stay in Canada. The duchess, a former actress, is well-acquainted with Toronto, where she lived and worked while on the cast of the U.S. TV drama Suits. (dpa/NAN)
