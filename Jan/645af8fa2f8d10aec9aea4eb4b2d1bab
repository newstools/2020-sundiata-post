(Sundiata Post) â€“ Cross River state government has given 7-day ultimatum to occupants
of illegal structures along major streets in Calabar to relocate their
businesses. Commissioner
for Environment in Cross River, Mr Mfon Bassey gave the ultimatum on Friday in
Calabar, during an inspection tour of the Watt market, Hewett Street, Stadium
road and the MCC junction. He
urged them to relocate their businesses to Watts, Marian or any other market or
face demolition. While
addressing the hawkers at different points, he said the state government was
committed to ensuring a clean and green environment, hence the need to relocate
all road side sellers back to the markets. Bassey
explained that the move was to ensure a clean and green Calabar, free of
illegal structures along the pedestrian walkways and the highways. He
expressed dissatisfaction with the traffic congestion along Watt market due to
the activities of road side sellers, who deliberately left the market space to
occupy the road side. He told
the hawkers that the ministry had earlier issued the ultimatum on Dec. 27 2019,
asking them to remove all illegal structures, shanties and containers off the
road. The
Commissioner also advised them to remove all illegal structures erected on the
drainage systems to allow free flow of water during the rainy season to avoid
flooding. He
warned that defaulters of the notice would face stiffer sanctions. The
commissioner stressed that under his leadership, the state would enjoy clean
environments and warm atmosphere that would be attractive to investors and
would also promote the industrialisation drive of Gov. Ben Ayade. (NAN)
