Cairo – Egypt’s ex-president Hosny Mubarak, who was ousted in a 2011 uprising, had undergone surgery, his son said on Friday. “My father underwent surgery yesterday [Thursday]. His condition is stable and he is fine,” Alaa Mubarak, the elder son of the 91-year-old, said in a tweet without giving details. Mubarak, an ex-air force chief, ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years.He was forced out of office following 18 days of street protests that hit Egypt as part of the so-called Arab Spring revolts. After his ouster, Mubarak faced several corruption lawsuits.While some cases were resolved via repayments rather than criminal proceedings, he already served a three-year jail term after he was convicted of embezzling state money. In 2017, he was acquitted of complicity in the killings of protesters in the 2011 uprising after a tortuous legal process that started months after his toppling.Mubarak was last seen in public in December 2018 when he appeared at a Cairo court and testified in the trial of his successor Mohammed Morsi.
