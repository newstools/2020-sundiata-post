US President Donald Trump has said no American lives were lost in last night missile attack by Iranian forces in US troops bases in Iraq. In his address today, Trump said, “only minimal damage was sustained in our military bases.” He said, “We must all work together to make a deal with Iran. President Donald Trump says the US is ready to embrace peace “with all those who seek peace”. Trump said this in a broadcast after the claim of Iran that 80 American soldiers had been killed in retaliation for the murder of Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian general. But in his speech, Trump dismissed the claim of Iran, saying no American was hurt in the missiles fired by Iran. “Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,” he said. “To the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future and a great future, one that you deserve. “One of prosperity at home and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.” He said.
