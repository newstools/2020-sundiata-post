By Moses Omorogieva Lagos – Team Lagos on Wednesday defeated Ogun Under 15 male and female rugby teams at the South West eliminations of the upcoming National Sports Festival. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Ogun team will now meet Osun team to decide who amongst them will represent the zone at Edo 2020. The two games went in favour of Lagos which beat Ogun 7-0  in first and 10-0 second half for male; played 0-0 first half for female and 8-0 for second half. Team Lagos Coach, Okeowo Samson, told NAN after the games that all the errors noticed during the games would be corrected during Edo festival. Samson said that his team would be in Edo 2020 for Gold, boasting that they were the team to beat. “Lagos team is the best rugby team in South-West. We are sure of the ticket. This is my first time as coach for Lagos team. Most of the players are first time comers also. “We have 25 males and 25 females good enough to give us gold. We are sure to qualify in this zone and hope to do better by God’s grace,” he said. An official and rugby referee, Abubakar Suraj, told NAN that Team Osun was still being expected at the camp. He said that team Lagos was expected to secure the ticket for the zone, noting that Rivers and Delta states were the only serious contenders at the national level. The referee said teams in the three categories in rugby – 15s, 10s and 7s – categories would meet on Thursday. “I am sure of Lagos State presenting formidable teams. We have the foundation of rugby game in Nigeria. We have won two silvers in Ogun. We have all the kitties for players. “The only challenge is the hostel for players as it is too congested for the players and we also don’t have good rugby pitch to play,” he said. (NAN)
