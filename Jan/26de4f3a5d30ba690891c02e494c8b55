Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called for a peaceful demonstration in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Monday in protest against the state of affairs in the country particularly what it sees as the miscarriage of justice on the Imo State gubernatorial election. According to a statement issued on Saturday in Abuja by Col Austin Akobundu (rtd), the National Organizing Secretary, the demonstration is in line with one of the decisions reached at the meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party on Friday. The exercise will take off from Legacy House, Maitama at 9.00 am. The statement said: “In line with the approval of the National Executive Committee of our Great Party, the National Chairman has directed that a peaceful, civil and non-violent protest be organised in the Federal Capital Territory to register the displeasure of the Party against the current state of affairs in the country, especially the miscarriages of justice of the Supreme Court against the lawfully elected Governor of Imo.” It added: “This is a clarion call to all lovers of Democracy as we join hands to save our dear Nation.” Recall that in a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court voided the election of Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP and handed the seat to Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressive Congress (APC).
