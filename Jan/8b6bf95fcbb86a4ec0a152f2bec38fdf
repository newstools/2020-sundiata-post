Teni and her boss, Dr Dolor paid a visit to the Ooni of Ife and they had a swell time with the traditional ruler. The singer took to her Instagram story to share videos of the visit. In the video, the Ooni kept on asking for the singer’s man and she jokingly mentioned Wizkid explaining that they have been “playing table tennis”. However, the Ooni was quick to disapprove of their relationship saying there must be another man for her but after much persuasion, Teni was able to convince him the Wizkid is not so bad after all.
