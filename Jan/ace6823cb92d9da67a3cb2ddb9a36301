By Adebisi Sogbade-Shittu Ibadan – An Iyaganku Chief Magistrates’ Court in Ibadan on Tuesday sentenced a Scavenger, Faruk Akano, 20, to six months imprisonment. Akano was sentenced for breaking into a high school and stealing window burglar-proof worth N175, 000. He, however, pleaded guilty to the charges against him. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Akano of Idi- Arere area, Ibadan, was in court on a three-count charge of conspiracy, breaking and entering and stealing. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs O.O. Ogunkanmi in her ruling, found Akano guilty as charged and sentenced him to six months imprisonment at Agodi Correctional Centre, Ibadan. Ogunkanmi, however, said the convict being a first time offender, should spent the term with hard labour to serve as deterrent to others. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Sikiru Opaleye, told the court that Akano and others at large conspired together to commit the offence. Opaleye alleged that Akano broke and entered into Nuhu Islamiya Grammar School, Kudeti, Ibadan on Dec. 31, 2019, at about 4 p.m. “He stole seven pieces of window burglary-proof valued N175,000, property of Nuhu Islamiya Grammar School, Kudeti, Ibadan,’’ the prosecutor said. He said the offences contravened Sections 390 (9), 413 and 516 of the Criminal Code Cap 38, Vol .II, Laws of Oyo State 2000. The case was reported by Rotimi Ogunleye of Monatan, Ibadan, at Sanyo Police Station, Ibadan. (NAN)
