Nwakpa told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday that by so doing, the athletes and technical officials would have adequate time to do the needful.
NAN reports that athletes in teams Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Oyo, Ekiti and Osun participated in the two-day South-West zonal elimination ahead of the 20th edition of the biennial NSF billed for Benin, Edo, from March 20 to April 1.
“The just concluded two-day South-West zonal elimination hosted by LSSC has come and gone where athletes in various sports and events have proved their competence.
“So, it is fundamental for the LSSC to make sure that all its preparations and plans for the festival begin to strengthen them for the task ahead.
“No doubt we are all expecting them to perform credibly and top the forthcoming medal table but the platform must be made available,” he added.
The former national boxing coach said that team Lagos that ended 4th position with 146 medals in the 19th NSF held in Abuja, came first in the just concluded Zonal competition followed by Ogun, Ondo, Oyo, Ekiti and Osun.
