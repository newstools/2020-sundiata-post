Adam had work, alongside a well prepared garden, before Eve landed. @Micbliss: This doesn’t just apply to Men alone. Women too should make their own money. Nobody wants a liability. With both of them earning, it’s easier to focus on the love. @johnawele: in the event u don’t make money ,what happens?Become a monk?I totally agree that money is vital in marriage..but then this girl just comes ur way even when u r broke,then love enters ur eyez,then u start reasoning marriage while still broke o,pls babes stay away frm broke guys @MistaYawan: Love is patient, love is kind, love takes no record of wrongs, love is not boostful, love is forgiving, is not easily angered… Without money if you have this kind of love, you marriage will be bliss, but if you think money will repair a broken marriage think again.
