British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson on Tuesday called on U.S. President, Donald Trump to replace the Iranian nuclear deal with his (Trump) own new agreement. Iran’s nuclear programmes have generated a lot of crisis in the Middle East. Following the assassination of powerful Army General, Qassem Soleimani, Iran has vowed to continue with its nuclear weapons. On the other hand, President Donald Trump had vowed that Iran will never have a nuclear weapon under his watch. “If we’re going to get rid of it, let’s replace it and let’s replace it with the Trump deal,” Johnson said of the 2015 nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. “That would be a great way forward. “I don’t want a military conflict between us, the United States and Iran, let’s dial this thing down,” Johnson said.
