Yesterday, part of popular Lagos market, Balogun market caught fire. In total, 9 buildings were razed as and some collapsed in the process. Jubril Gawat, Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Lagos State Governor on New Media, said the fire started after someone, possibly a trader, attempted to refuel his generator while it was on. An explosion ensued and the fire immediately started spreading. Below are photos of the aftermath of the fire. Source
