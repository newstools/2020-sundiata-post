By Ronke Asagun Ibaji (Kogi) – The Onu of Iyano in Ibaji Local Government Area of Kogi, Mr Vincent Ogah, has urged the Federal and State Governments to provide good access roads for the people of his domain to facilitate easy transportation of their farm produce to markets. Ogah made the appeal while conferring some important personalities with Chieftaincy titles at his palace in Ibaji on Friday. He said the area was blessed with good arable land, saying that all it needed from the government were good roads and electricity. He said lack of access roads had compelled the people to be transporting their farm produce to markets in town through the river, which he said, was very risky as the boats could capsize anytime. He advised the newly-coronated chiefs to be good citizens and to help people in need. Speaking at the occasion, the Administrator of Ibaji Local Government, Mr Williams Obiora, also appealed to the State Government to provide good roads to the area. In his remarks, Chief Tony Ogah, one of the newly-coronated chiefs who was conferred with the title of ”the Okakwu 1, Ojo Ache-one of Ibaji Land, thanked the monarch and his kinsmen for finding him worthy of the honour. Ogah promised to do more for his people through his NGO (Tony Ogah Foundation), and to ensure that Ibaji enjoyed peace. On his part, Chief Amaze Edime, who was also coronated as Ochu- Ufane (The Moon Light) of Ibaji, thanked the people of Ibaji for finding him worthy of the title conferred on him. Edime assured that he would always uphold the honour bestowed on him by standing firm to show more love and concern for the affairs of the land in every capacity he found himself. (NAN)
