If they want peace to give them peace if they want war to give them war! I am right behind you. “My life is a hundred folds better than yours and I’m not going anywhere. ” It’s not only BBNaija I won, but don’t forget I also bought a house. Why are you guys obsessed with me. I won deal with it. “History only remembers the winner, even if someone else wins ill still be the first female to win BBNaija so deal with it.” #Mercy attacks #Titans , #Tacha'a people #official_mercyeke , #simply_tacha #bigbrother #BBNaija A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Jan 13, 2020 at 4:25am PST Source
