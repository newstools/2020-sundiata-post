By Hussaina Yakubu Kaduna – The Kaduna State Government, says it is providing medical interventions in about 963 public health facilities across 23 Local government areas to enhance healthcare services and tackle maternal mortality. The State Acting Governor, Hadiza Balarabe announced this at the flag-off of the Maternal Child Health Week in Kachia Local Area of the State on Wednesday. Balarabe said the intervention which would last for one week, was specifically meant for women and children. She said some selected private health facilities are also participating in the intervention exercise. She appealed to mothers to utilize the opportunity and access health services for them and their children. Balarabe said the Maternal Child Health Week would be conducted twice a year to provide effective intervention for women and children in the state. “The targeted people are pregnant women at the post natal period and children under five years of age,” she said. Balarabe noted that, the State has poor health indices for women and children, “hence the need for goverment to make the indices right by making improvement in maternal health and progress in child health. “We therefore have interventions targeted at those areas which need the cooperation of other people,”she said. The deputy governor urged the women to spread the health week intervention across communities for others to benefit. Balarabe also urged the women to use the facilities even after the week, as it is only when they are in use that the goverment can provide more drugs and consumables. The State Commissioner for Health, Amina Baloni expressed the commitment of the government in ensuring that the health of women and children was given adequate attention. On his part, Chairman, Kachia Local Government, Peter Agite, lauded the state government for the intervention, meant to improve the welfare of the people. (NAN)
