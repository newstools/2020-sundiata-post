By Nicholas Obisike Enugu – Norbert Okolie, the Media Officer of Rangers International Football Club of Enugu, says the club’s players deserve praise for their 1-0 win over Pyramid FC of Egypt on Sunday. Okolie said victory in the 2019/2020 CAF Confederation Cup Group A Match Day 5 fixture in Egypt showed that Rangers were back to reckoning. Speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) in Enugu on Sunday after the match, Okolie said the win was for all Nigerians. NAN reports that Ifeanyi George’s goal in the 73rd minute of the match separated the two sides. “This is the type of results we have been looking for all this while and I hope the other matches will be in our favour,” he said. Okolie noted that the club’s management, technical crew and the players are now receiving the reward of their hard work. “I hope that Noiadhibou FC of Mauritania will do us a favour by defeating Al Masry in the other match of the group,” he said. The club spokesman called on the players not to relent with the positive results but should see it as a challenge. “The job has just begun and now that the results are coming in our way we have to double our efforts. “Thank God we signed good players in the current window and the players are all doing well. “We have someone like Israel Abia who has been banging goals left and right in the league,” he said. Okolie also thanked the club’s supporters for their belief in the club even when things were not going well for the club. He urged the supporters to always have faith in the club as the players are up and doing at the moment. “Now that we have five points from five matches, we can still go beyond the group stage. “As our motto ‘Never say die’ implies, we are going to fight till the end as our last match will be against Al Masry FC of Egypt in Enugu,” Okolie said. Rangers now occupy the third position in the group with five points behind Al Masry who are in second position with six points. (NAN)
