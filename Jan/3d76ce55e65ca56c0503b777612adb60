By Ifeanyi Olannye Asaba – Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has urged the private sector to collaborate with his government to provide a cleaner and aesthetic environment in the state.The governor made the call on Friday in Asaba, while on a working visit to some beautification projects executed by Asaba Capital Territory Development Agency.News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the projects included sets of shops – SMART Delta Delicacies and Fruit Arena at Summit Road, Nnebisi Road and NTA Junction, Fede Bus Stop.The governor also unveiled the new Dennis Osadebe Statue on Anwai Road, Asaba.Okowa said that partnerships with the government would help to create better amenities for citizens.He commended the Agency and some private concerns for the structures while calling on others to join the government in beautifying the state capital by giving back to the people.“I am aware that some of the structures have been built either directly by the State Capital Territory Development Agency or in partnership with some Deltans.“I am aware that two of the structures were donated to the state government by some very supportive Deltans and people doing business in Delta.“As a government, we are very grateful, and some willing Deltans and non Deltans who are trading in the state have also started to offer support to the state government by building some of these structures.“We will continue to ask and encourage our people to partner government because government cannot do everything alone,” he said.The governor charged the capital development agency to sustain it’s pursuit of clean and beautiful environment in the state capital.He said that the agency should continue to work judiciously to keep Asaba, the state capital, and its environs cleaner and better.“I can see that in the last few months there have been a lot of changes in the sanitary character of Asaba and I think that it is very instructive, not just in the capital territory.“I want to use this medium to urge our people and let them know that sanitation is good; it is good for us to keep our environment clean.“It is good for us to put in a lot of effort to make sure that our environments are tidy and in so doing every Deltan, non-Deltans living in our cities must be committed to doing what is needed to keep our state clean.“I hope that our people will continue to support the programmes of the agency and also the programmes being put in place by the Warri-Effurun Development Agency to ensure our environments are clean.“I am glad that Deltans are cultivating the culture of not disposing of their waste wherever they feel like, particularly in our cities and I hope that actions are taken to ensure that those who deliberately dump waste inappropriately are sanctioned accordingly.“We are in the process of engaging environmental marshals; a task force has been created so people should be warned,” Okowa said.Earlier, the Director-General of the Agency, Mrs Onyemaechi Mrakpor, said that the main purpose of the agency was to redesign and reconstruct structures that would give the state capital a face lift and add value to the lives of the people.She commended the governor for the support given to the agency and assured that more work would be executed to help in achieving the Stronger Delta mandate.
