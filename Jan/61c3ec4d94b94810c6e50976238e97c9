Innoson motors seem to be going the indigenous way of naming their vehicles after prominent Nigerians who have touched lives. The automobile company released a brand new model to the public called INNOSON IKENGA. The INNOSON IKENGA is a beautiful Cross Over Vehicle and it was named in honour of Dr Dozie Ikedife, Ikenga Nnewi. It will be recalled that Innoson is a Nigerian automobile and bus manufacturing company. It was founded by Innocent Chukwuma and runs a plant in Nnewi in the state of Anambra. 70% of the car parts are produced locally, while the rest is sourced from Japan, China, and Germany.
