Medical personnel attending to some members of Pigba-Kasa Community in Apo District, Abuja during a health outreach organised by a coalition of NGOs on Saturday, 25/1/2020 By Justina Auta Abuja – A coalition of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) on Saturday distributed free drugs and treated mosquito nets to some members of Pigba-Kasa Community in Apo District of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Representing the coalition, Mr Joseph Eshua, the Director, Communication and Branding, Junior Chamber International (JCI), Abuja Unity, said the outreach aimed at promoting health through sensitisation on prevention and cure of malaria. Eshua said the efforts became necessary to eradicate malaria, which was one of the biggest killer diseases in the country, adding that over 1,000 persons comprising of 600 adults and 400 children benefitted from free drugs and treated mosquito nets. “ Some of these people benefitted from malaria drugs, multi vitamins, treated mosquito nets, bags, shoes, and other relief materials to address their health challenges, which will improve their health status,” he said. Responding, the Community Chief Leader, Ayuba Kalobi, commended the efforts of the NGOS, assuring them that the health talk would be judiciously used to promote their health status in the community. Kalobi, therefore, called on other organisations and the government to continue to support communities in the areas of health, education and other social amenities. A beneficiary and member of the community, Mrs Joy Musa, said the efforts would reduce the incessant cases of malaria recorded in the community. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that medical experts were also on ground to provide free medical check-up and counselling, HIV and malaria testing, BP checking, as well as health talk on malaria in the community. The NGOs include Leader Joe 1808 Foundation, Stitchs’ AID Foundation, Sam Empowerment Foundation, MarieCare Initiative, Peach AID Medical Initiative, Mercy Michael Foundation, Thriving Initiative, A Well Woman, Celade Community Health and Mmayen’s Kitchen.
