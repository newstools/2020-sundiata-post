Many Nigerian students schooling in Ternopil State Medical University in Ukraine have planned a protest after a 6th-year Nigerian medical student committed suicide because she was allegedly frustrated by the school. Badmus Ololade Rafiat, a final year medical student, felt she had no choice but to take her life after she was expelled from her school for failing to pass the mock exam ahead of the final MBBS. According to reports, she made attempts to transfer to another school to take the MBBS as other students do, but the school allegedly kept frustrating her and refused to provide the transcript needed for the process. They allegedly only gave her the option of returning to Nigeria to reapply for a student’s visa to start all over again. After her pleas yielded no result and her dean refused to reconsider her case, she wrote a suicide note and took her life on Thursday, January 16th.
Following her death, the school mourned her and put up a notice on a wall in the school with her photo. They expressed their condolences to her friends and family. The school added that she killed herself because she was depressed and suicidal. But friends of Ololade, better known as Pemisire, said she wasn’t suicidal or depressed as the school claim. They said she was only frustrated at having to start all over again after studying up to her 6th year in medical school. Friends of Pemisire blame the school authorities and they have planned a meeting to protest the alleged unfair treatment that caused her to take her life. “Lets meet in Centre @ 12pm,” a notice sent out by Nigerian students in the school reads.
