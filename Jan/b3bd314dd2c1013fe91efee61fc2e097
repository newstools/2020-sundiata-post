Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Friday, declared that plots to unseat his counterpart from Edo State, Godwin Obaseki will fail. Umahi, who is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, vowed that nothing will stop Obaseki’s re-election later in the year because he has done well and deserves to continue in office. Addressing Obaseki’s wife, Betsy and other Southern Governors’ Wives who paid him a courtesy call in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State said: “Power belongs to God and no matter what anybody will do it is God that has the final say and I can assure you Ma, you know as an apostle of the most high God I also prophesy. And because of the good work, your husband is doing for the people of Edo State no man can unseat him. “I made this statement so that the glory of God will become larger. It happened here in Ebonyi, I have a testimony of what God can do. Even in our NEC meeting, when Obaseki speaks, you see Economics. You see a man that came from private sector background. And so, we can’t wish that away. So, congratulations to you in advance and to all of us. “You know the Governors; we have so many elections. First is the primary, the second one is the poll, then the third one is the tribunal. Then another one is the appeal and then the election of the elections is the supreme court. “So, it is not an easy thing and if the hand of God is not upon you, you can’t scale through all these hurdles. And so, it is God who has brought all of us to leadership and I say double congratulations to all of us”. Source
