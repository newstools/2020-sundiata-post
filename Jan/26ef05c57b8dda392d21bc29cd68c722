By Thompson Yamput Jos – Lt. Gen. Jerry Useni (rtd), Peoples Democratic (PDP), Candidate in the 2019 Governorship Election in Plateau, has urged citizens of the state to remain calm following the Supreme Court verdict. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), recalls that the apex court had on Monday upheld the election and declaration of Gov. Simon Lalong of APC, as the duly elected Governor of Plateau. Useni, who gave the admonition in a statement he signed on Tuesday in Jos, also charged the people to be committed to statehood. The PDP candidate called on all Stakeholders, officials and supporters of the party, and indeed the people of Plateau State, to “remain calm, peaceful, and not to react in the face of any provocation.” “It has been a long struggle to get to this point in our sustained and vigorous efforts towards freeing the people of Plateau from the new form of retrogressive politics, and people-alienating governance that we have come to witness in recent years in our dear state. “Do not trade blames as it would not lead to any good destination. It is also no time for mourning since we all fought gallantly together. “Let us stand together and keep the party going knowing well that our best is yet to come from our political struggle in the state. “In resolute, let us face the future with pride, confidence and dignity. “As long as God gives us breath, we must keep the vision for total security, unity and prosperity of our state as our enduring agenda.’’ Useni therefore saluted and thanked the people, especially PDP members and supporters, for their unwavering support, hard work and perseverance during the struggle.
