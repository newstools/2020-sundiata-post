Geneva – The head of the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees has warned that the announcement of U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan could result in unrest.Christian Saunders, Acting Chief of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) made the statement on Friday in a news conference in Geneva.“A lot of Palestinians are in a state of shock at this time, in a state of disbelief over the Trump peace plan.“While it was difficult to predict how their reaction would evolve, we certainly have serious concerns that it will result in an escalation in clashes and in violence,’’ he said.Saunders also demanded that the voices of the 6.5 million Palestinian refugees must be taken into account if any lasting and just settlement is to be reached.
