Tokyo – Former Japanese emperor Akihito temporarily lost consciousness at his residence in Tokyo, local media reported on Thursday. The 86-year-old collapsed on Wednesday, Kyodo News reported, citing the Imperial Household Agency. But palace officials found no abnormalities in subsequent medical checkups. His health condition was back to normal on Thursday, Kyodo reported. Akihito relinquished the Chrysanthemum Throne on April 30 in Japan’s first abdication in 202 years. His son Naruhito ascended the throne the next day. Akihito suffered several bouts of ill health in the latter half of his term. (dpa/NAN)
