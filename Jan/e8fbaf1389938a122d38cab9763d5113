A Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court sitting in the Bwari area of Abuja has sacked Senator Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Progressives Party (YPP). Senator Ubah was the lawmaker representing Anambra South district in the upper chamber of the National Assembly. Vanguard reports that a high court sitting in Kubwa area of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on Friday, January 17, declined to set aside its judgement on the nullification of the election of the candidate of Young Peoples Party (YPP), Ifeanyi Ubah, for allegedly using a forged National Examination Council (NECO) certificate to contest the senatorial election that held in the state on February 23, 2019. It would be recalled that Ubah had approached the court to set aside the judgement which he insisted occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice against him. He decried that he was neither served with the court processes nor hearing notice with respect to the suit before the court proceeded to deliver the judgement against him. Following his application for stay of execution, Justice Kawu, on December 4, restrained the Senate president from swearing-in Uzoh, pending the hearing and determination of the motion challenging the verdict. The court equally ordered all the parties, including the INEC to maintain status quo till it decides the merit in Ubah’s contention. In a ruling on Friday, January 17, Justice Kawu, however, held that Senator Ubah’s application to vacate its judgement lacked merit and accordingly dismissed it. It equally dismissed a motion another claimant to the PDP senatorial ticket, Chief Chris Uba, filed to be joined as an interested party in the substantive suit marked CV/3044/2018, which was filed before the court by an electorate in the state, Anani Chuka.
