A relative has gone online to show the injury inflicted on her sisterâ€™s child by the house help. In a photo shared on Facebook, the child is seen with a bandage on her head and blood stains on her school uniform. The Facebook user who shared the story said the child is just 2. She had returned from school and was still in her school uniform when the maid pushed her and she hit her head on the sharp edge of a wall, splitting her scalp. The girl bled so much and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment and an X-ray. See below: Source
