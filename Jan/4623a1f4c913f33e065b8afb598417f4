Punch Metro reports that a retired teacher in the Barkin Ladi Council Area of Plateau, Mr Iliya Dafet, has been shot dead by gunmen, who attacked his house in the Gana- Daji community. A family member, who gave his name as John, told Punch Metro in Jos on Thursday that the deceased, who was in his late fifties, was relaxing with his wife and children in his compound around 7:30pm when the gunmen attacked them on New Year Day. John said, “At 7:30pm yesterday (Wednesday), the gunmen who were wearing masks just came to the compound. One of them scaled the fence and made straight to the man who was just chatting with his wife and some of his children in the compound. “They started struggling with the intruder, who immediately brought out his gun and shot the man in the head. Other gunmen also rushed in and hit a log of wood on the man to ensure that he is dead before they made their escape. “He was a Primary School Headmaster in the Barkin Ladi Local Government until he retired recently. He was rushed to a hospital in Jos South Local Government Area where doctors on duty confirmed him dead. His corpse is now lying at the mortuary. We have not seen something like this before.” John said the incident was reported at the Divisional Police Headquarters in Barkin Ladi Council Area. He said the DPO had visited the scene with his men and promised to get to the root of the matter with a view to apprehending the culprits.
