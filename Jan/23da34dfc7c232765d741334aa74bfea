Jakarta – Indonesian Police, on Wednesday said they arrested a suspect in a fraud case that bilked millions of dollars from a prominent Saudi princess. According to Ferdy Sambo, the police’s Head of the general crime unit, Princess Lolowah al-Faisal made a police complaint in 2019, alleging that two Indonesians reneged on an agreement to build resorts in Bali. Al-Faisal, a 72-year-old daughter of the late Saudi King Faisal bin Abdulaziz, had paid 500 billion rupiah (or 36.7 million dollars) over the course of several years to the two people to buy land and build two villas in Bali’s Gianyar area. Sambo noted that the property had not been completed and the total value of the land and buildings was estimated at only 2.7 million dollars as of 2018, based on an assessment by a public appraiser. According to him, one of the suspects was arrested on Tuesday in Jakarta. “The suspect was formally detained on Wednesday. We are still looking for the other person,“he said. Princess Lolowah is one of the most publicly visible female members of the Saudi royal family. (dpa/NAN)
