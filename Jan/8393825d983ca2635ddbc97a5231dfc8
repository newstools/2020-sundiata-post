I own a company, none of my staff knew me as the owner except the Manager and the Secretary. I donâ€™t visit, I told both of them not to disclose my identity to the other staff. One day, I visited the company and I saw my Ex, I asked the Manager and he said she is one of their staff. I instructed the Manager to promote her to personel officer, which he did. A month later, I went there as a job applicant, as she saw me with my application and CV, she rejected me outright, she remembered all the past, and told me never in this company would I get employment. I came the following day to beg her, she refused and called the security men to throw me out, then I left. On Monday, I went to the company in my real identity and I entered her office with the Manager who introduced me to her, she knelt down crying and begging that all the family depends on her for survival. If you were in My Position, What Would You Do?
