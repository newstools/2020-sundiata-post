A Kano Upper Shari’a Court on Monday sentenced 22-year-old singer to death by hanging for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad. The Presiding Judge, Khadi Aliyu Muhammad Kani, gave the judgement after finding Yahaya Sharif-Aminu guilty as charged. Sharif-Aminu, a resident of Sharifai in Kano metropolis, was accused of committing blasphemy against the Prophet in a song he circulated via WhatsApp in March 2020. After the incident, protesters burned down the singer’s family home and led a procession to the Kano Hisbah Command’s headquarters in protest against the singer’s action. The court also sentenced one Umar Farouq of Sharada quarters in Kano metropolis to 10-year imprisonment for making “derogatory statements concerning the Almighty Allah in a public argument.” Aggrieved youths on March 4 staged a protest on the premises of the Kano Hisbah office, over what they described as an alleged blasphemous song against Prophet Muhammad.

Sharif-Aminu had composed a song containing alleged derogatory verses against Prophet Muhammad, which ignited violence against his family members. But the family house of the singer, located at Sharifai quarters in the Kano Municipal Local Government Area, was set ablaze by irate youths who described the song as blasphemous. Investigations revealed that the singer, said to be a follower of Tijjaniya sect, is a member of Faidha group, who are known for their preference of Ibrahim Nyass (a famous Senegalese Islamic scholar), over Prophet Muhammad. The Nation Hundred of aggrieved youths stormed Kano Hisbah office on Wednesday to protest alleged blasphemous song portraying the Holy Prophet Muhammad in bad light. The protesters displayed various placards, alleging that the government and the security agents in the state were reluctant to handle the alleged case, which informed their action.… March 4, 2020 In "News" By Godwin Onyeacholem Indeed, for any keen observer of governance in post-colonial Africa, Nigeria must be a very depressing address.
