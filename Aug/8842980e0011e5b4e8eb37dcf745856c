Brussels  –  EU Council chief Charles Michel has postponed his wedding in French Montmeyan after the area was put under Belgium’s list of orange zones, his spokesperson confirmed to dpa on Friday. Michel’s wedding to Amelie Derbaudrenghien was scheduled for Saturday in Montmeyan’s Var department, an area that has now been added to the list of places for which Belgium recommends travellers quarantine on return. A new date for the wedding has not been set yet, his spokesperson said. The 44-year-old European Council president is not the first top European politician whose wedding-plans got thrown off schedule by the pandemic. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had to postpone her wedding twice.(dpa/NAN) Brussels - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the divorce deal for Britain to leave the European Union (EU) on Friday.This is one of the final steps required before Brexit in a week’s time.“Charles Michel and I have just signed the Agreement… January 24, 2020 In "Foreign" Brussels/Athens - EU Foreign Policy Chief, Josep Borrell, will on Tuesday head to Ankara for crisis talks about the military escalation in Syria’s Idlib province, as well as the refugee situation in Turkey, his office announced.
