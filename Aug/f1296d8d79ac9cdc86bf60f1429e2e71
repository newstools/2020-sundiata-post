By Chibuike Nwabuko  The charges were filed based on the alleged “defamatory remarks” made against Governor Nasir El-Rufai in November 2019. The Bishop was said to have criticized the governor over the plan to demolish St. George Cathedral in Zaria, a historical structure of 110 years old. Though the Kaduna state government bowed to pressure and backed down from its attempt to demolish the old cathedral. But Bishop Ogunyemi was invited by the police and went through rigorous interrogation and later arraigned before a magistrate with consent from the Kaduna State Ministry of Justice. The clergyman pleaded not guilty to the charges, and he was granted bail and the case adjourned to October 28, 2020. The Kaduna state director for Public Prosecution said that there is an ongoing negotiation between the parties to have a “Peaceful resolution” of the matter. We can recall that in November 2019, when the Government of Mallam Nasir El-Rufai said that it was going to demolish the 110-year-old cathedral, Bishop Ogunyemi was quoted by The Cable as saying “any attempt to demolish any of the church’s property will be taken as an assault on Christians” He added that Mallam El-Rufai is being groomed to take over from President Mohammadu Buhari in 2023 but the Governor will never be president. These statements infuriated Governor El-Rufai and he subsequently took this legal action against the Bishop. Source: The Cable
