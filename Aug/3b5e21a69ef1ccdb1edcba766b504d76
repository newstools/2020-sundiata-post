He now faces life in prison.On Wednesday, Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said the movement’s position on the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon had not changed before or after Tuesday’s decision.Fadlallah told Lebanese Television al-Mayadeen that, “We in Hezbollah have made our decision not to engage in assessment of what the court issued.“Hezbollah had repeatedly denied links with Hariri’s killing in the terrorist attack that hit his motorcade on Feb. 14, 2005 in Beirut.Apart from the politician, 21 other people were killed and 226 injured by the massive suicide truck bombing.The attack triggered a local and international outcry and unleashed massive protests in Lebanon.Ahead of the ruling, Hezbollah’s Chief Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address on Aug. 14, that the court does not mean anything to them, as such, not concerned with any of its decisions.(dpa/NAN) Jerusalem – Israeli soldiers at the Lebanese border opened fire at suspected Hezbollah activists on Saturday, the military said, the first such incident since Israel launched a crackdown on cross-border tunnels into its territory.
