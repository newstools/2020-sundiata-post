By Joy Kaka Abuja  – A 51-year-old businessman, Abubakar Aliyu, on Tuesday begged a Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court to compel his 17-year-old wife, Khadija Akarami, to return to their matrimonial home.Aliyu, who resides at Suleja, Niger state, told the court that he had been in a relationship with Akarami since 2015 and got married to her on June 15, 2020.He said that Akarami left her matrimonial home on June 20 and moved to her parents house at Dutse Alhaji, Abuja.“All efforts to make her return home proved abortive,” Aliyu said.The petitioner, however, pleaded with the court to compel his estranged wife to come back to his house.Responding, Akarami said she was no longer interested in the marriage.“I am no longer interested in the marriage. I was forced into the marriage from the outset,” she said.Akarami’s mother also told the court that she did not want her daughter to continue with the marriage to the petitioner.She said that the petitioner should have settled the matter within the family instead of taking it to court.The presiding judge, Justice Muhammad Adamu, ordered the respondent’s father to appear in court on the next adjourned date to testify.Adamu adjourned the matter until September 2 for continuation of hearing.
