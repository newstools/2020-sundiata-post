Leader of the newly formed political group and former Speaker, House of Representatives, Ghali Umar Na’abba has been summoned by the Department of Security Service (DSS). According to a brief statement issued this evening by NCFront and signed by its Head, Public Affairs Bureau, Dr Tanko Yunusa, the invitation by the security agency is as a result of the interview the astute politician granted on Channels Television on Thursday. During the said interview, Na’abba had revealed the agenda of his group to bring about a new Nigeria that works for all Nigerians – a statement which the secret police appears to be uncomfortable with. However, the statement said the NCFront National Co-Chairman has decided to honour the DSS invitation and therefore shall be visiting the DSS Headquarters in Abuja on Monday at noon. “All NCFront organs, structures and allies nationwide are hereby put on the alert as eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” the statement added.
