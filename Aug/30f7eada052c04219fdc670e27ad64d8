By Muhammad Nasir Bashir Dutse –  The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Jigawa command, has warned drivers against use of worn out tyres, particularly during the rainy season, to avoid road crashes. Mr Solomon Agure, FRSC Sector Commander in the state, gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Dutse on Friday. Agure said that the warning was imperative as use of worn out tyres could cause brake failure, which could lead to road crash, loss of lives and property. He also advised that drivers should always note the preliminaries (Pre-vehicle Use Checks) and ensure their vehicles are in good working condition. “Other proactive measures to be taken by drivers include low speed, driving in track of other vehicles and keeping moderate following distance,” the sector commander said. Agure urged drivers to ensure head lamps and wipers were working, park and wait if rain was much and ensure that brake systems were in good condition.
