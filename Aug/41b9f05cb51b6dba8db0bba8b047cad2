Godwin Obaseki, the PDP governorship candidate over alleged gross misconduct and divulging of official secrets.Mr Roland Asoro was elected as Deputy Speaker.According to Okiye, we recognise the constitutional rights of some three Assemblymen to support the candidate of their choice.“But that should not distract them from coming to work to carry out the job they were elected to do,” he added.Okiye, however, said that the house was committed to the protection of democratic rights of the people adding that the legislature remained the sacred institution in democratisation process.
