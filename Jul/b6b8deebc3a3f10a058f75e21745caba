President Edgar Lungu of Zambia has sacked the Minister of Education in the country after his nude video clips went viral on social media. Minister of Education in Zambia, David Mabumba was sacked on Wednesday. The Minister’s dismissal was contained in a statement from the Presidency, signed by Lungu’s spokesperson Isaac Chipampe.
