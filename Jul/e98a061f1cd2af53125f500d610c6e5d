Nollywood actress Regina Daniels is indeed having the best time of her life after she recently took fans on a journey to her husband’s car garage housing some of the most expensive cars in the country. In a video she posted on her page, the actress could be seen showing off her billionaire husband’s multi-million naira car garage. The garage had G-wagon, Porsche, Brabus, and a Ferrari in it. The camera soon panned towards two G-wagons packed beside each other and the mother of one was spotted stylishly walking into one of them as a song played in the background. As soon as she got to one of the cars, she opened the door and stepped in like the madam that she is. She was donned in black leggings, a yellow sweater, and white sneakers to match.
