It urged Nigerians to take precautions to protect their older relatives by wearing a face mask in public, practising hand and respiratory hygiene and maintaining a physical distance of two metres from others. “Ensure that if you do share a toilet and bathroom with others, they are cleaned after each use. Where possible, consider drawing up a roster for bathing, and you use the bathroom first at the start of each day. “Encourage frequent handwashing with soap and water by all other household members and disinfect frequently touched surfaces e. g door handles, light switches, TV remotes etc throughout the day. “Keep shared spaces well ventilated and minimise the time spent in shared enclosed spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. “Where possible, sleep in a different bed and endeavour to maintain physical distancing even within the household. “Do not share towels and beddings or use commonly shared household items including cutlery, drinking cups etc,” the body stated. The health agency also said it does not own quarantine or treatment centres. The body said that this was the responsibility of the state governments or relevant teaching hospitals. The NCDC said it only provides guidance on set-up of standard isolation centres, national case management guidelines and training for health workers across the country.
