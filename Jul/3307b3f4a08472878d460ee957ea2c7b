Taipei  –  Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu says Taiwan is to establish a representative office in the East African breakaway nation of Somaliland, in a breakthrough in relations between the two politically isolated nations. Wu told a news conference in Taipei on Wednesday after the two nations had signed an agreement in February that Somaliland would also reciprocate with a representative office in Taiwan. “However, since Somaliland is not joining the list of Taiwan’s formal diplomatic allies, the offices would not be designated as embassies. “But Taiwan Representative Office and Somaliland Representative Office, we support Somaliland’s efforts made to pursue freedom and democracy,’’ Wu said. He added that Taiwan had been in talks with Somaliland since 2009, and would keep working with like-minded countries with shared values. Somaliland is a self-declared independent state of 3.9 million people. It declared independence in 1991, however, is not recognised as a state by the international community. Wu said the two nations’ bilateral relations would focus on fields ranging from fishery, agriculture, energy, education, health care to information and communications technology. Politically isolated Taiwan has just 15 formal diplomatic allies, mainly small, developing nations. Beijing’s “One China” principle requires that other nations avoid formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan if they want full relations with China. Taiwan has had an independent government since 1949; however, China considers the democratic island part of its territory. (dpa/NAN)
