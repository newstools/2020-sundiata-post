Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh has stated her own side of the story following reports that she was arrested in Dubai and deported after drugs were found on her. The mother of one stated that such never happened because she was only involved in a scuffle with security authorities. Tonto Dikeh revealed that the scuffle occurred after one of the guards called her a prostitute in Arabic. ”That incident in Dubai was not drugs because if it was I would be in jail. It had nothing to do with drugs or alcohol even. “On that day, I was insulted by one of the guards. He said something very derogatory to me in Arabic, I think Lebanon. It’s called Sharamuta which means prostitute, it means a call girl and I was not so dressed. “But it was a show, so I had like a very amazing bra inside and this blazer on top. To them, it is Haram when you are not dressed properly. So that is where all of the altercation started. That was the only problem, any other information is just false,” Tonto said. According to her, she did not give details about the incident earlier because she has a home in the country and would not want to jeopardise her stay there. “I really don’t want to go into so much detail about Dubai because I have a home there now and I want to be able to enter freely after all of this and that is why I never really talked about it,” the actress added.
