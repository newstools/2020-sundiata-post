Princess Shyngle has confessed in a social media post that she’s bisexual – that means she is sexually attracted to both men and women. The actress took to her Instagram Stories to give an update on her weight loss journey. She stated that she doesn’t want to lose so much weight because she needs her butt to be intact so that it can get her either a new man or woman. She said: “I need that booty to get me either a new man or woman. “You guys know I swing both ways, right? I love boys, I love girl. I’m a proud bisexual girl. I have nothing to be embarrassed about.” Watch the video below: "I'm a proud bisexual girl.
