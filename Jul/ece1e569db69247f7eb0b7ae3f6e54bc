In 2023 the personality of Buhari will not be on the ticket,” Udoedeghe advised. The party scribe assured all aggrieved members of the party of the caretaker committee’s readiness to reconcile, integrate and engage them in the party’s activities.

Ken Nnamani of the 2018 election contestants. “I believe that the report is still with the party.

He also drew the attention of the caretaker committee to need for the party to out in place a reward mechanism for committed party members, recalling that some members of the coalition have been left high and dry since 2018. “Since 2015, we from the south-south and other geopolitical zones we know what it means to have APC as your surname.
