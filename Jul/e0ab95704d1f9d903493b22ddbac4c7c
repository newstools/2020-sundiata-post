The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested a bank guard and two others in Benue State over fraud. The suspects who confessed, allegedly specialize in defrauding bank customers through Automated Teller Machines (ATM). EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale, in a statement on Thursday, said the suspects were arrested at the bank premises located in the North Bank area of Makurdi. The modus operandi of the trio (names withheld) was to obtain details of customers who sought help to withdraw cash through their ATM. In the process, they would swap the figures and other details such as passwords in the customer’s ATM card and clone it to defraud the unsuspecting customer. EFCC found 31 ATM cards of different names and banks, smartphones, 2 laptops, 16 SIM cards, 1 modem, 1 flash drive, and fake currency notes from them. Oyewale added that one Mazda car, Millennia model, was also recovered. The suspects will be charged to court after investigation.
