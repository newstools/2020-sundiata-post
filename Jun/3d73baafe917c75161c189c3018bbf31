Moscow –   Russia’s domestic intelligence agency said Wednesday it had foiled a terrorist plot in Crimea, and that five suspects in the case had been arrested. A group of terrorists had been planning to attack a market in the city of Simferopol with improvised explosive devices, the FSB intelligence agency said. Russian authorities have confiscated explosive devices, weapons and munitions in the case. The five suspects are thought to have links to Ukrainian nationalist groups, the FSB said. Tensions have been running high in Crimea since the peninsula was annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Despite massive international pressure, Moscow has declined to heed Kiev’s demands for the return of Crimea and has expanded its military presence there. (dpa/NAN)
