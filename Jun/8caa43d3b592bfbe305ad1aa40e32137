By Abdullahi Shugaba  Katsina  –   The Katsina State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Masari, said on Friday that he would want his successor to perform better than him. Masari stated this while briefing newsmen to mark this year’s, Democracy Day in Katsina. He said that any person that would succeed him should not only consolidate on what he met on ground, but should make efforts to do more for the people. The governor however said that it was his prayer to leave the state at the end of his tenure better than he met it. Masari said that the era had passed when leaders prayed for the failure of those that would succeed them. “We are working to improve the wellbeing of our society; then why should one pray for failure of those to succeed him?” He appealed to the people to give him the necessary support and cooperation to enable him to provide more dividends of democracy to them.
