The President of United States of America, Donald Trump has began building fences around the White House following protests by people seeking justice for George Floyd and calling for an end to police brutality. As the protests intensified and demonstrators packed themselves outside the White House, US President Donald Trump reportedly hid in a bunker in the White House. He later claimed he was “inspecting” the bunker, not hiding. Now, walls are being built around the White House. Photos and videos shared online show tall black walls going up.

Americans took to Twitter to mock their president for ‘hiding himself behind a fence.” See Photos below: Fence perimeter around the White House today pic.twitter.com/OyIWcNDmrZ Source United States President, Donald Trump, has broken his silence as he gave explanation why he was taken to an underground White House bunker.
