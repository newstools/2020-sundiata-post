The Dhaka-bound ferry “Morning Bird” capsized after it was hit by another launch “Moyur-2” in Buriganga river at Shyambazar area of old Dhaka at around 9.33 a.m. local time, she added. The ferry was reportedly carrying over 100 passengers. According to the official, search and rescue efforts are underway by the Fire Service and Civil Defence and other authorities.
