Nigerian popstar, Peter Okoye on Saturday, said he and his family tested positive for COVID-19. “It took me a lot of courage to say this,” he said in a live session on his verified Instagram page. For weeks “I was in prison in my own house. I was sick. I was COVID-19 positive. It took me a lot of courage to say this. I caught the virus. “I used to think this whole virus thing was a joke and I took it for granted.” Okoye said his daughter and wife also later tested positive, including his cook and one of his nannies. The former P-square group member said he and his family have now tested negative after treatment. “If you think this whole virus is fake or you don’t have anyone that you know, I am telling you now that it is real,” Okoye said.
