A late penalty from Bruno Fernandes secured a 1-1 draw for Manchester United against Tottenham on Friday night. Fernandes struck from the spot in the 81st minute after Paul Pogba was brought down by Eric Dier. Paul Pogba returned to action for first time since 26 December to earn the late penalty that helped Manchester United with a crucial point in a match with Tottenham Hotspur.

United keeper David de Gea failed to stop Steven Bergwijn’s powerful 27th-minute drive.
