Yaounde –  Cameroon’s House Speaker of National Assembly, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, on Wednesday called for national solidarity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. “Fighting the coronavirus challenges us all. “United we stand, divided we fall,’’ Cavaye said during the opening plenary of the June session of the National Assembly,” he said. He urged that all Cameroonians should adhere to what he described as sacred union to fight the pandemic. He said Cameroon was on the right path to combating the disease but noted that people were still disrespecting social distancing rule. “In the coming days, all members of parliament will begin an initiative to support efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus in the country,” he said. Cameroon’s health authorities have reported more than 8,500 COVID-19 cases.
