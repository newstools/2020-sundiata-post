Tel Aviv –  Up to 250 guests will be allowed at weddings and other religious ceremonies in Israel under new COVID-19 guidelines announced by the government on Friday, despite rising infection rates in the country. The new guidelines will take effect on Sunday, according to the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Health Ministry. They would apply to ceremonies like bar and bat mitzvahs. Those attending would have to engage in social-distancing and organisers would have to ensure enough space so that all participants could stand two metres apart. Lists would have to be kept of everyone who attended. However, the relaxation of rules is limited to such religious events. Similar secular events are limited to 50 people.
