London  – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday dismissed criticism of his government’s plans to implement local lockdowns if there are flare ups of the novel coronavirus and of an app to trace the spread of the virus. At prime minister’s questions, the opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer suggested both systems were not yet ready before England eases its coronavirus lockdown from July 4. “We have a very effective cluster-busting operation which is designed to ensure that we keep those outbreaks under control. “I am not going to pretend that this thing is beaten or that the virus has gone away. “We have to remain vigilant and local councils will be supported in doing their vital work in implementing local lockdowns,’’ Johnson said in response. He, however, challenged Starmer to find any other country that has a functioning tracing app. (Reuters/NAN) •Boris Johnson British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday the country will have 25,000 virus tracing staff recruited by June so the country can “make progress” in its strategy to keep easing the nationwide lockdown.
