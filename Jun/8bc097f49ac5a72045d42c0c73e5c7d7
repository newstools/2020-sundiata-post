Commissioner of Health Dr. Rafiu Isamotu said one of the six who tested positive died before the result was released. “Of the remaining five cases, three had contact with the Osun-based India national, whose status was confirmed last Friday. The trio, it was further learnt, are domestic staff of the India national.” Isamotu said the deceased, who had an underlying ailment, had been buried in Osun State by the family. He said the Surveillance Unit of the state’s COVID-19 Team has embarked on contact-tracing. “From our findings, the late patient was receiving treatment in Lagos, but when he got to Ibadan where the mother lives, he was advised to turn to Osun for medical help. “Unfortunately, we lost the patient even before we could admit him into our medical facility,” Isamotu said.
