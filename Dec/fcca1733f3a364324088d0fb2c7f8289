Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Banks have resolved to further tighten lending conditions in the first quarter of next year (Q1’21) following continued increase in loan defaults by debtor customers. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) stated this in its Credit Conditions Survey report for the fourth quarter, 2020 (Q4’20). The report, among other things, revealed that banks in Q4’20 recorded more loan defaults in terms of secured loans to households, small businesses and medium sized enterprises.
