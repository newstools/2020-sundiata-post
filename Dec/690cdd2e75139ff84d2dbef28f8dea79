Popular Nigerian movie star, Ruth Kadiri has asked about why partners who are in love cannot freely go through each other’s phones.  The actress said this while answering a question. “Is it ever OK to check your partner’s phone?” the question reads. In response, Ruth said: “Why call him or her your partner if you can’t go through their phones??? Once the shreds of secrecy is allowed then so many things sets in. My thought. Correct me if I’m wrong.”
