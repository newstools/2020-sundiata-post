The widespread EndSARS protest, which rocked the entire Nigeria for weeks in October this year, has resumed.  The protests resumed in Lagos State on Thursday with protesters marching by Tejuosho Road in the Yaba area of the city. SaharaReporters gathered that older women and some young men brandished various placards in the area, defying the scorching heat to march for almost two hours. They continued to chant, “End SARS and we march for our children.” A number of them were also seen carrying the Nigerian flag in their hands, with microphones to make their voices audible. On Friday morning, more Nigerians vow to storm the streets, in what they termed a “second wave of protests.” The hashtag also appeared on the US trends in the early hours of Friday. Tweeting on Friday morning, an activist, Gbenga Sesan wrote, “#EndSARS protests are back. They will be peaceful. Actions will be distributed. Volunteers will manage logistics. There will be no donations that can be blocked. Communication will be seamless. The goal remains the same: #5for5. Don’t wait for anyone; this is YOUR country.” Comedian DrCraze wrote, “#EndSARS second wave, third wave, plenty waves, Any Wave! I’m READY!” A Twitter user, @FabricbyFabric, wrote, “#EndSARS is back! Our Demands: Unfreezing of all bank accounts related to the #EndSARS protests. Release of illegally detained peaceful protesters.-Justice for victims of 20•10•20 #EndSARS.” A medical doctor, Olufunmilayo, wrote, “#EndSARS is back on the trend table. It’s number 1 in Nigeria, and it’s also present on the USA trend table. Don’t hide under this to start swallowing food late tonight thinking I won’t notice. Dear hardened hoodlums, Lend your voice to the struggle. Stay awake to tweet. Not eat.” Source
