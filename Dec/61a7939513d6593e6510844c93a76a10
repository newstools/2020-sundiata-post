Leading Broadband Company, Smile Nigeria, has literally set the nation’s broadband market on fire with their new range of amazing data plans which give consumers much more value for their money. With the introduction of the new range of data plans, a new buzz has been created with the quartet of data plans including Bigga, Freedom, Jumbo and 365 plans. The new 130GB Bigga plan offer customers 130GB valid for 30 days at only N19,800. Once the 130GB is depleted customers will enjoy 3GB FREE daily until the validity period of the 130GB Bigga plan expires. Now that’s a lot of value! The new Freedom plans which give non-stop data are specifically designed for heavy data users and consist of two elements; three standard Freedom plans, as well as the choice of two FreedomBooster Add-ons. With the Freedom3Mbps plan, customers enjoy 30 days of Always connected, Non-stop data at data speed of up to 3Mbps for only N20,000. The Freedom6Mbps plan also offers 30 days of Always connected, Non-stop data with data speed of up to 6Mbps at only N24,000. The new Freedom BestEffort plan gives customers TRUEUnlimited, No Limit internet experience for 30days for only N36,000. The FreedoBooster Add-ons are perfect for customers who want access to more data per day than what their subscribed Freedom plan offers, and is only available to customers with an active Freedom3Mbps and Freedom6Mbps plan. For only N2,000 customers can get the Freedom NightBooster for TRUEUnlimited internet experience between midnight and 6AM, ideal for night owls. The Freedom AnytimeBooster at only N6,000 gives active Freedom plan customers TRUEUnlimited internet 24/7. A FreedomBooster Add-on will expire on the same day as the active Freedom plan the customer is subscribed to. Another veritable part of the amazing new data plans are the three new Jumbo plans, which offer validity longer than 30 days. These plans are jam-packed with data from 90GB Jumbo at N20,000 valid for 60 days, 160GB Jumbo at N34,000 valid for 60 days, and 200GB Jumbo at N40,000 valid for 120 days.
