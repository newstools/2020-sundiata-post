Abdulrasheed Maina has been ordered to be remanded at Kuje Correctional Centre pending the conclusion of his trial.  The remand order was given by Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday. At the resumed trial on Friday, the counsel representing Maina, Adaji Abel formally withdrew and the counsel engaged by Mr Maina asked for a short adjournment to enable him to study the facts of the case. Justice Abang granted the application for adjournment on the ground that the defendant who is presumed innocent is entitled to legal representation. He subsequently adjourned the case to the 8th of December for a continuation of trial.  Source
