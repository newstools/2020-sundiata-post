An Independent Investigative Panel (IIP) set up by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has summoned Ahmad Sani Yerima, a former Zamfara State to probe his alleged police impunity.  The order was given after Yerima was accused of using some police officers to arrest, torture and detain a Katsina State-based businessman, Alhaji Musa Wapa, over a claim of N23 million. Yerima’s name was reportedly mentioned many times in Wapa’s complaint before the Justice Suleiman Galadima (retd.) led panel, making it necessary for him to be invited to defend himself before the panel.
