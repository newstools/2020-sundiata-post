Emeka Ojukwu, son of the late Igbo leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, has indicated interest to contest the governorship seat of Anambra State in 2021.  In a statement on Thursday, he said he was contesting the governorship of the state on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance. In the statement, he slammed his father’s widow, Bianca Ojukwu, over her recent interview that the Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, could not be a replacement to late Ojukwu as APGA leader. Bianca had in the interview criticised APGA leadership over plans to name Obiano the leader of the party, stating that Obiano knew little or nothing about the philosophy of the party. But Ojukwu (Jnr) in the statement faulted Bianca’s comments. He said, “I would have taken a pass on the insinuations, innuendos and outright falsehoods made in the (Bianca’s) interview. I find it exigent from the perspective of an insider, to present the truth so as to preserve and protect the ideals that my late father and mentor held sacred. “Given his standing by birth, heritage, disposition and calling, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu never shied away from fully expressing his feelings, observations and apprehensions. “As a matter of fact, he documented his views concerning Biafra and Nigeria in books and live interviews for ease of reference. Any attempt, therefore, to recast or present his views regarding Biafra or Nigeria without proper references should be considered dead on arrival. “Claims therefore of what the legend told or did not tell the claimant (Bianca) about Biafra/Nigeria, should be regarded as the views of the said claimant, in pursuit of what, I don’t know.”  Source
