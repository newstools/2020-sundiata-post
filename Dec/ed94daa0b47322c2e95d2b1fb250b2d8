Amara Kanu, wife of football legend, Nwankwo Kanu has reacted after being called out by a former Super Eagles star, Osaze Odemwingie.  Odemwingie had accused Amara of constantly messaging him on social media without her husband’s knowledge. He asked her to desist from such habit as her husband has his number and can call him if they have anything important to talk about. Reacting, Amara Kanu said she only wanted to talk about family that’s why she has been messaging him. She wrote: “@odemwingie_81 oh no no no. Kindly take this post down. @kingkanu4 is fully aware of this. We want to talk to you as a family.”  Source
