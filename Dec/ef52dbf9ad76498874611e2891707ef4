Yahaya Bello had earlier blamed politicians for the spate of insecurity in the country, as cases of bandits attack and kidnappings go on a rise nationwide. Bello while speaking on Channels Television breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily said the country would be safer when politicians stop using thugs and criminals during elections. He said; “When politicians stop the use of thugs, touts, or some group of criminal that is when we will begin to have safety and security.” Reacting to the governor’s statement, Melaye labelled him as the vice-chancellor in the institution of thuggery. “Yahaya Bello’s public condemnation of thuggery, an institution where he is the vice chancellor is a serious sign of psychotic disorder and mental inherited hormonal imbalance,” he tweeted.
