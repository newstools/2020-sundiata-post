ABUJA (Press Release) – Our attention has been drawn to a highly fallacious and spurious letter purported to have been written by the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, a Fulani socio-cultural organization, to the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief John Nnia Nwodo.The said letter congratulated Chief Nwodo for his able leadership of the apex Igbo socio-cultural body and enjoined him to ensure that Professor George Obiozor from Imo State emerges as his successor as it is the turn of the state to produce the next President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.They claimed that discussions with the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, indicated that Ambassador Obiozor would protect the interest of the Fulani as President General, and as a recompense for Chief Nwodo’s expected role in making this happen, they had forwarded his name to the presidency for an appointment. What insult ! What impudence !If not for the currency the letter has gained having gone viral in the social media, one would’ve ignored it as a laughable piece of junk fit for the trash can, but this time it is a joke gone too far, the discerning public having known the image and integrity of Chief Nwodo who has had a successful and unblemished public service career as a two-time Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo.So, to totally debunk and deflate the despicable and malicious, half-baked smear campaign, the following clarifications are important : Chief Emeka AttamahSpecial Adviser to President General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo.
