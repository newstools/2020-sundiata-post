After just three years in the saddle, Julie Okan-Donli, was on Tuesday replaced by President Muhammadu Buhari with Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim taking her place as the new Director-General of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) Again, it follows the pattern of the President to replace a southerner removed from positions with a northerner, in his government, which has attracted immense criticisms from across the country from those accusing him of nepotism, including some elements from the north, like second republic politician, Junaid Mohammed. Okah-Donli Okah, from Bayelsa State, was appointed by Buhari on April 13, 2017, to head the office created by then President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2003 to fight the high level of human trafficking in Nigeria, making it a period of three years and eight months she would spend in her office. It is not known the reason for the appointment, but the NAPTIP boss recently secured global recognition, when she was named by the United Nations General Assembly as a member of the Board of trustees for UNODC-managed United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. Announcing the appointment, presidential spokesman, Garuba Shehu described Suleiman-Ibrahim as a holder of BSc (Sociology), Masters of Arts (Management) and Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degrees, Mrs Sulaiman-Ibrahim, hails from Nasarawa State. Until her new appointment, she was a member of the Nasarawa State Economic Advisory Council as well as Special Adviser on Strategic Communication to the Minister of State for Education, the statement, said.
