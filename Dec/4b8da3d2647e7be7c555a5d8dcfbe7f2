An unfortunate incident occurred at Oriuzor community in Ezza North Local Government Area of Ebonyi state on Sunday, November 29 as a beautiful young lady identified as Chinenye and her boyfriend, Chinedu Nwode were shot by suspected cultists. The killings reportedly followed a renewed clash between two rival cults in the state, the Baggers and Aye confraternities. It was gathered that the couple were returning from a child dedication in Oriuzor to Onueke when they were shot dead. The killing was said to have angered some persons suspected to be members of the Aye Confraternity, who in turn killed one Chikwado Nweke and another man at Onueke community in the same local government. Spokesperson of the State Police Command, DSP Loveth Odah, who confirmed the incident on Tuesday, December 2, condemned the spate of unreported cult killings in the area. “This is bad and I don’t know why these things are more often heard of in this area. This is condemnable and it’s unfortunate that those who lost their loved ones to these crisis have not come up to identify themselves. How can these things be happening in that place and these are brothers and they are just killing themselves,” said Odah. “On hearing this ugly news, the Ebonyi State Commissioner of Police, Mr Philip Maku, deployed men of the command in the area to ensure that more lives are not lost. The police are investigating the matter and soon, we will tell you what really happened.” she added.  Source
