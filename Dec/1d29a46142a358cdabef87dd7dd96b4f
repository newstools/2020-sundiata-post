The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has expressed shock following reports that lawyers representing the police have gone to court to stop various judicial panels set up to probe police brutality and other offences. The IGP has now directed immediate investigations into the suit purportedly challenging the legality of the States’ Judicial Panel of Inquiry. In the suit, the plaintiff urged the court to stop the various panel inquiry and the Attorney-General of the 36 states from probing the allegations against the disbanded SARS and the police unit in the law suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/1492/2020. The defendants, who were sued by the NPF, includes the Attorney-General of the Federation, the National Human Rights Commission which set up the Independent Investigative Panel sitting in Abuja, the Attorneys-General of the states, and chairmen of the states’ panels making them a total of 104. The various panels of enquiry was set up by the National Economic Council with members including the 36 state governors and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, following the aftermath of the recent nationwide #EndSARS protests demanding an end to police brutality. The IGP has now expressed the disapproval of the Force Management Team on the matter and ordered investigations into the alleged role of the Force Legal Section including its Head. A statement released by the spokesperson of the Force, Frank Mba, says the Force Legal Officer has been queried and may face further sanctions if found guilty of dereliction of duty. Mba said the IGP is committed to fulfilling all his obligations with regards to the disbandment of the defunct SARS, the ongoing Judicial Panels and all other police reforms.  Source
