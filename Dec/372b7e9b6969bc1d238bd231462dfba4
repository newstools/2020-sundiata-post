Billionaire businessman, Ned Nwoko revealed that he got married to actress, Regina Daniels just three weeks after they met. He also said he can take a new wife if he chooses. In an interview with BBC, the politician disclosed that he married Regina within three weeks of meeting her. “I met her and I liked her. We got married within three weeks. I married all my wives within the same period. I don’t believe in dating anybody to marry them. Don’t date anybody you want to marry. When you marry them, you begin to fall in love within the marriage. Even in my culture, as it were as a kid in the 60s, people were not dating. They arranged marriages from family to family; they choose a wife. Most girls were expected to be virgins when they get married and they build a family from there. Because they did not know each other before they got married, there was a lot of excitement and a lot of learning to do. But Regina and I is a story that is interesting because before I met her, I did not know about her. I do not watch movies; I never watch movies. I met her the first time when she came to my house with her mother and her siblings because my place in Delta is a tourist place. They came to look around and I liked her and that was it. “So whether I marry another wife or not; she knows it can happen. I come from a very polygamous environment. I love children so I want more children. She knows this and my other wives know it so we will see what happens in the future,” Nwoko said. Watch the video below; The Nation
