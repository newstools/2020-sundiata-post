A man who no longer wants to be called by the name, “Lawal Buhari” has put up a public notice to let people know.  In the notice shared by a popular Hausa news portal on Monday, it seems the man wants to be called by the name “Lawal Dan-Idi” henceforth. It’s not clear if the reason for the change of name is because of President Buhari as the notice is written in Hausa. However, from the comments by Facebook users it seems so. Source
