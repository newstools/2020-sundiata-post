The Federal Government had announced that it has engaged 17,000 Nigerian youths in rabbit farming.  Executive Secretary of National Agricultural Land Development Authority, Paul Ikonne who made the announcement said the programme had already commenced in some states which include Imo, Abia, Cross River and Oyo states, and is expected to engage more participants in the southern part of Nigeria. Ikonne disclosed that the agency would provide the rabbits, cage, vaccine and training for participants free of charge, and further added that the first set of beneficiaries would be required to bring back the kitten from the rabbits they train so as to be used in the empowerment of other youths. He Said; “The President had inaugurated the national young farmers’ scheme, and we intend to take in 774,000 young Nigerians into the entire agribusiness. This programme has started implementing the first leg, which is our animal husbandry. “In this segment, we are doing goat and rabbit rearing. A lot of people do not know the potentials, the benefits and the money they can make from rearing rabbits. Rabbit has an entire value chain, nothing is a waste farming rabbit. “So we are engaging our youths into rabbit farming, NALDA has designed a programme to take in 17,000 rabbit farmers especially in the South, and we have commenced the engagement in some states.”  Source
