By Chibuike NwabukoAbuja (Sundiata Post) –  Abdulrasheed Maina, the wanted former chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT) was on Monday evening arrested in Niger Republic by the operatives of Niger Republic intelligence service in collaboration with Nigeria’s anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. A top intelligence officer said that the arrest was made on an existing mutual relationship and security agreement between the two countries. The former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT) is facing a 12-count money laundering charge filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). According to the EFCC, Maina used his firm to launder about N2billion. He allegedly used part of the proceeds to acquire properties in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Maina jumped bail, a situation that prompted Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court to order the remand of his surety, Senator Ali Ndume. The Borno South lawmaker was freed last Friday. EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, said he was yet to be briefed on Maina’s arrest.
