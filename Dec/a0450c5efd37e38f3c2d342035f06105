Joseph Ozoemena aka Ozo has finally given a response after his private Whatsapp chat was made public by his love interest, Nengi. Nengi leaked her private chat with Ozo where Ozo asked her if she thinks he’s not religious enough, and Nengi in her response, asked him if he can pray. Ozo added that he doesn’t ask God to strike down people whenever he prays to him. Sharing the chat, Nengi said; “SMH. This one is always complaining that I like to cast and bind too much”. Reacting to this, Ozoemena reposted the chat on his Instagram page and stated openly that prayers work.
