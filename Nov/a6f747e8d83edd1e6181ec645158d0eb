A latest study by Agusto & Co found that mobile banking applications remained the most popular digital banking platform, backed by the rising number of mobile phone users. The research, which examined customers’ preferences towards digital banking platforms hosted by 10 selected banks in Nigeria, revealed that Internet banking and USSD banking ranked second and third among the most preferred digital banking platforms among Nigerians. This was as WhatsApp, chatbots, and telephone banking ranked low among banking platforms used by Nigerians, the Consumer Digital Banking Satisfaction Index report stated. Agusto & Co Consumer report stated, “Mobile banking applications remain the most popular digital banking platform. “The increasing use of mobile banking has also been backed by the growing base of mobile phone users, which has grown by a five-year compound annual growth rate of six per cent to 184.4 million as the end of 2019.” Digital payments on PoS terminals across the country had also grown as agent networks had increased by 313 per cent from over 85,000 in December 2018 to about 345,000 as of June 2020, the Chief Executive Officer, Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities, Ronke Kuye, said in an article published in August. Kuye said these agents operated in all the 774 local government areas and had processed a total of 76 million transactions valued at N1.3tn between January and June 2020. A revised guide to bank charges issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria took effect in January this year. The apex bank reviewed downward electronic transfer, ATM charges as well as card maintenance fees. The CBN said the new charges aimed to reduce the costs of banking services to customers and encouraged them to embrace electronic channels. It directed Nigerian banks and other institutions facilitating payments to implement N10 for electronic transfers below N5,000, and N25 for electronic transfer between N5,000 and N50,000. Previously, bank customers paid N50 charge for electronic transfers below N500,000. “Only electronic transfer above N50,000 will attract N50 charge,” the CBN said. The guideline, which had since been implemented by the financial institutions, also slashed charges for cash withdrawal via other bank’s ATM to a maximum of N35 after the third withdrawal within the same month from N65 after the third withdrawal within the same month.
