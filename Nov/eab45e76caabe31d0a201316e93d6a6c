Ike Ekweremadu, the former Deputy Senate President has stated that Igbo presidency can be possible in 2023 if the South East engage in negotiations with the Northern region.  Ekweremadu said this on Wednesday, November 25, when he spoke at the 2020 edition of the Brandish Meeting of Minds Colloquium. “There is clamour for Igbo presidency today. And I believe it can only be realised if we engage ourselves in conversation with northern Nigeria to buy into our initiative. There can never be a universal decision of any ethnic group and the rest of us in this country. It is only dialogue and conversation that can be equity to all parts of the country.”he said.  Source
