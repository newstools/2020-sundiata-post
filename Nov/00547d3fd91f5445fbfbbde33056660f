By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –   The national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party has grieved over the killing of the Chairman  of the Sabuwa Local Government chapter,  Katsina state, Alhaji Lawal Dako, by suspected bandits in the State. In a statement released via it’s official twitter handle, the PDP described late Alhaji Dako as a patriotic Nigerian, a man of peace and an exceptionally loyal officer of the PDP, who made immense sacrifice, at his level, towards the unity, stability and growth, not only of our great party but also Katsina state and Nigeria at large. The PDP asserted that the killing of a patriot like Dako by bandits, is yet another painful testament of the failure of the government of the day to stand up to its responsibility to guarantee the safety of our citizens. The party bewailed that innocent Nigerians have continued to fall victims of bandits, insurgents and marauders, who have been having a field day unleashing violence against our citizens while the government of the day continue to pay lip service to our security challenges. The PDP noted that the escalated attack on defenceless communities by bandits is a loud wake up call on President Muhammadu Buhari to heed the demands of Nigerians to rejig his security architecture and get more competent hands to manage the security of our nation. It therefore, urged President Buhari to do all to check banditry in our nation as well as ensure that those behind this heinous act are brought to book The party commiserated with the Dako family, the PDP fold in Sabuwa and Katsina state as well as his friends and associates, and prays the Almighty God to grant mercy to the faithful departed and fortitude to his loved ones the bear the irreparable loss.
