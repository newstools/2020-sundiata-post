Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri took to Instagram page on Thursday morning, November 26 to blast women who bleach their skin and undergo surgery to have a banging body.  Using former Miss World, Agbani Darego-Danjuma as an example, Reno averred that women do not have to bleach or undergo surgical enhancement to be pretty. According to him, Agbani did not bleach her skin or undergo surgical procedure and she still ended up getting married, having a child, and is a ”source of joy to herself and her race.” His Post Reads; ”When you bleach and surgically enhance your body, you are not just saying ‘I hate myself’, you also teach young dark skinned girls to likewise hate themselves. No matter how many rich old men date you, you remain a danger to yourself and society! Love your dark skin. Live a life worthy of emulation. Look at your photos before you bleached. You were the epitome of beauty. A natural African woman. You do not need to be light skinned and have surgically enhanced features to be loved. You were already lovely. Look at @AgbaniDarego. The first and only Nigerian to win the Miss World Pageant. Black and beautiful. She did not bleach or surgically enhance herself. Yet, she is married, has a child, and is a thing of joy to herself and her race. A beacon of virtue and pride to the Black Race. Young Black girls can look at her and feel beautiful. Black is Beautiful. Say it with me-I’m Black and I am proud!”
