The President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro has alleged that the United States electoral battle between President Donald Trump and Joe Biden was marred with fraud. Biden’s win has been endorsed by the General Services Administration (GSA). The former Senator has won more than 80 million popular votes and 306 electoral votes; Trump has nearly 74 million and 232 electoral votes. On Sunday, Bolsonaro made it clear that he would not acknowledge the President-elect Biden yet. He spoke while casting a ballot in municipal polls, The Independent reports. “I have my sources of information that there really was a lot of fraud there. Nobody talks about that. If it was enough to define (victory) for one or the other, I don’t know,” he said. On his recognition of Biden, the Brazilian leader replied: “I am holding back a little more.” Bolsonaro, however, raised concern about his country’s voting system and called for return to a paper ballot system for the 2022 presidential election. Last week, Trump announced he would leave the White House if the Electoral College affirms Biden as the winner. The U.S. State Department has assured that it would work with the Democrat on transition. The Nation
