A gas pipeline belonging to Shell is currently under attack in Bayelsa by unidentified armed men, jangling nerves in the affected communities as gas leakage has been suspected. The attack started in the early hours of Monday, sources told The New Diplomat. The facility was allegedly blown up by explosives at the Ikarama and Kalaba communities in Yenogoa local government. It was gathered that the pipeline links the Shell’s Adibawa flowstation at JK4 (Edagberi/Betterland) in Ahoada West local government area of Rivers State and Shell operated integrated gas gathering plant at Obunagha. The explosion has caused palpable tension in the communities just as local farmers have had to abandon their farmlands over a possible ignition in the area. Locals are currently worried that the explosions have continued as the sound of gas escaping into the environment through the facility was being heard.
