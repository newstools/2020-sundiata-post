A Former minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili has questioned the mental and physical health of President Muhammadu Buhari.  She has now called for a total assessment of Buhari’s physical and mental state by an independent panel. Ezekweili demanded that a medical panel be set up to assess the President, adding that the condition of Nigeria has become too grave for citizens to sit still. The former Minister said this on her official Twitter page, stressing that the State house physician cannot be trusted hence the need for an independent panel. Her posts read: “I think that at this stage and depth of fragility of the Nigeria-State, Privacy has to yield ground to our right to know as citizens, the state of health of Buhari. “We really must assess the physical or mental capability of Nigeria’ President to carry on the duties of office. “Citizens can collectively push for an Independent Panel to help us make the critical medical determination of the state of mind and body of our President Buhari. “The conditions of Nigeria have become too grave for us all to sit still and watch a train wreck in the making. “As an extremely concerned citizen, I hereby demand for a Medical Panel on Buhari since we obviously cannot trust the State House Physician to provide us accurate information. ” Ezekwesili emphasised that a mental and physical assessment is important as Nigerians need full disclosure before the situation in the country worsens. “It is reasonable demand now for citizens to have full disclosure on the state of health of Buhari,” Ezekwesili tweeted.
