Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reduced President Muhammadu Buhari to a “lame duck”, going by the way leaders in the ruling party have been scrambling to position themselves ahead the 2023 elections.In a statement on Saturday by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the main opposition party said the actions of the APC leaders were being driven by the manifest failure of the Buhari administration in all sectors of national life.The PDP observed that the frenzy at which the APC has commenced the 2023 election campaign, just a year into President Buhari’s second tenure, further confirmed that the APC leadership is now looking beyond its current structure and government, apparently having realised that the next three years under Buhari would be a waste.The party further asserted that “the underground moves by APC leaders to disown the Buhari administration, given its failures, the conversation about possible change of their party’s name as well as the plot to destabilise the PDP are signs of desperation to hold on to power despite APC’s failures and  explicit rejection by Nigerians.“Our party and, indeed, discerning Nigerians have seen through the rambling of the APC, which is merely raising dusts to foul the political firmament in a bid to cover for its lack of internal cohesion, failure in governance and reneging on the promises they made to Nigerians in order to have access to power. “The attitude and character of the APC have manifestly shown that it is mortally afraid to stand election in 2023, given that Nigerians have seen through their antics and are determined not to have anything to do with such a deceitful, beguiling, divisive and incompetent party in future elections.“APC has shown that it is a party without conscience; the reason it has failed, in the last five years, to bring together a Board of Trustees that ought to serve as the custodian of its supposed ideals and principles,” the statement said.The PDP further noted that it is not surprising that under five years, the APC has remained inchoate, uncoordinated, rudderless and totally unable to operate a steady and stable national leadership.This, the party said, showed why the administration is plagued with confusion, infighting, widespread corruption and collapse of its central governance command structure.Continuing, the PDP said: “It is equally not unexpected that APC’s illegal, factional and lazy national caretaker committee would resort to lies, deceit and political scavenging, given that it has no ideas to proffer to its failed government on critical issues of governance, particularly security and economy. “Our party charges the APC factional caretaker committee chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni, to stop chasing shadows and go back to Yobe State, which has almost been taken over by bandits since he abandoned his electoral mandate for politics in Abuja.“Our party therefore counsels the APC to end its grandstanding, refund the over N15 trillion stolen by its leaders and get ready to disband. They have burnt their goodwill with Nigerians and their recourse to loud shenanigans cannot save them. Surely, Nigeria is better with PDP.
