One of Nigeria’s most popular singers, Naira Marley, has accused Turkish Airlines of racism.  The singer took to social media to accuse Turkish Airlines of “racial treatment”. In a post on his Twitter page on Sunday, the controversial musician described the company — which is the national flag carrier airline of Turkey — and its staff as “racists”. The ‘Soapy’ crooner also claimed that he has video evidence and witnesses to substantiate his claim — although he is yet to release any of them. “Turkish Airlines all your staffs are racists and I have video evidence and witnesses. I’m not mad anymore though. We gonna teach you all how to love. I’m color blind by the way,” he wrote. It was not immediately clear what informed the singer’s post which has already garnered nearly 11,000 likes and 1,400 retweets as of the time this report was filed. The airline has not replied to the singer’s comment yet. Efforts by TheCable Lifestyle to also reach the company as of the time of filing this report did not materialise. The company’s customer care unit could not be reached for response while text message sent was also not replied.
