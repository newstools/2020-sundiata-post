President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, November 26 disclosed that Nigeria has a total of 200 million people living in poverty while asking the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to consider this when sharing production cuts.  The President stated that asides the 200 million poor people, the nation has a severe deficit in infrastructure, saying that the weight of responsibility was too much. Buhari also welcomed the decision of the African Petroleum Producers’ Organisation (APPO) to site the headquarters of the African Energy Investment Corporation in Abuja, pledging the full support of the country in ensuring the successful take off of the organisation. At a meeting with Dr. Omar Farouk from Nigeria, who is the Secretary General of the organisation at the State House on Thursday, Buhari also gave assurance that Nigeria would pay for its share subscription.
