Today I am voting for the first time in my life for the President of the United States, and it’s for someone I truly trust … me.”  Kanye shared photos from his election day adventure while voting in a bright blue hoodie and black sweat pants | @KanyeWest Twitter West, however, at the time of this report, has gotten a total of 60,569 votes from just 12 out of the 50 states in the country, excluding battlegrounds like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.
