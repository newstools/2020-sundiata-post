According to Daily Post, the Akwa Ibom State police command has denied arresting a food seller.  The Police denied having in custody one Glory Edet, a restaurant operator on Itam road, Uyo. Glory was accused of cooking with water used in bathing corpses to attract and retain her customers. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko Macdon gave the rebuttal in a statement on Thursday following online publications that the command arrested the woman who was said to have confessed to the crime. SP Odiko called on anyone with useful information relating to the issue to contact the police with the name and address of the mortuary, name and address of the mortuary attendant and the investigating police officer handling the case as well as date and place of arrest. The statement reads in parts, “the attention of the Akwa Ibom State Police Command under the leadership of CP ANDREW AMIENGHEME, FDC has been drawn to an online message which has gone viral. ”In the said message, one Mrs Gloria Edet who is alleged to own a big and popular restaurant along Itam market road, Uyo, was said to have been arrested and detained at the State Police Headquarters, Ikot Akpan Abia, Uyo, for buying from a mortuary attendant, water used in bathing dead bodies in preparing her meals for sale. ”For the avoidance of doubt, the Akwa Ibom State Command has not arrested, interrogated or had in custody any Mrs Gloria Edet. “However, anyone who has any information relating to the said issue should contact the Police or furnish the Police with the following amongst others: The name and address of the mortuary, the name and address of the mortuary attendant, the investigating Police Officer (IPO) handling the case, the date and place of arrest, etc.” The PPRO warned peddlers of fake information to desist forthwith or face the full weight of the extant law.
