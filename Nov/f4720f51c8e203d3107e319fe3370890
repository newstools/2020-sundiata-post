In few months from now, we are coming back to see how they are doing. “Moreso, we just finished the training for all the beneficiaries of the grants, about 10 of them who were carefully selected.

On why the Club administered polio vaccine while Nigeria has been certified polio free, Onyilo said: ‘Yes we are certified polio free but we cannot relent. Remember that about 3 years ago, we were nearly certified but because of some little outbreak here and there, we went back. So we want to sustain ourcertification as a polio free nation by making sure that every child is immunized. “This process will have to continue until we are absolutely free from polio that is why we are doing what we are doing here. So essentially that is why we are here impacting on the adopted Community as a humanitarian organisation, Onyilo added.
