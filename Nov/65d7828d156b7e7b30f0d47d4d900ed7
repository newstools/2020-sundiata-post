Dewy Oputa, the daughter of Charly Boy has taken a jab at her father for the second time after he made a recent post about accepting her sexuality. According to her, she can’t stomach such pretentious behavior anymore. Charly Boy had earlier taken to social media to state that he’s proud and grateful to have a gay child. In a post shared on his social media page, which he labeled “parents only” He said that he found it difficult at first to accept his daughter as gay. He states that he’s close to his children and he loves them to bits so when his daughter came out of the closet to him, he accepted her wholeheartedly. In reaction to his post, Dewy who is based in the United States of America, has called him out, describing his post as clout chasing. She went on to narrate how she was kicked out of the house due to her sexuality, adding that he doesn’t even pick her calls. See what she wrote below; “Gaslighting at its finest. It’s quite unfortunate that my life is nothing but content I just can’t wrap my head around the hypocrisy. All this for a drop of clout,attention and praise from strangers just to feed your ego. Honestly I was going to just free this situation because I’m used to this toxicity and mentally I’m tired but after seeing this i can’t stomach this pretentious behavior anymore because on a normal level this man no Dey even pick my call. 2017 I got kicked out of the house and was damn near homeless and if not for my friend I wouldn’t have even had food or Shelter! Fortunately for me I had a return ticket to come back to Atlanta, I moved back here with zero dollars not even knowing where I was going to live or where my next meal was going to come from! I was literally living couch to couch and lord knows how tirelessly Iv worked so I could have my own stability! You didn’t even know if your daughter was dead or alive anything could have happened to me. But on social media you father of the year. You have literally put Instant gratification from strangers before your own blood.”.
