Early indications suggested Trump would win Georgia – but it’s now looking very close. Why? The chart below shows how the vote share in narrowing as more mail-in votes are counted. Mail-in votes are thought to favour Biden – one theory being that Democrats are taking the pandemic more seriously and are therefore more likely not to vote in person. A similar trend is being seen in Pennsylvania – though interestingly, the opposite is happening in Arizona, where Biden’s initial lead has been substantially reduced.  Trump tweets ‘Stop the Count!’ STOP THE COUNT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2020 15:06 Key points:  14:50Trump campaign to make ‘major announcement’ Donald Trump’s campaign says it will make a “major announcement” later. Former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell, former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt, chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp and Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald will host a press conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, at 8.30am PST (4.30pm UK time).It is not known what will be said, but Mr Trump has made unsubstantiated claims of “major fraud” and says he’ll go to the Supreme Court over the election. His campaign has launched legal challenges in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia and asked for a recount in Wisconsin.  Has the race been targeted by disinformation – and how are social media giants responding? According to a joint assessment by US intelligence agencies, the Russian state sponsored a disinformation campaign which brought the integrity of the last presidential election into disrepute. Has anything similar been identified in 2020? Votes are still being counted in a number of key states and the margins for victory remain wafer-thin. It is in this period of uncertainty following the votes being cast that provocations could have the most damaging impact. Chris Krebs, the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has stated CISA will “remain vigilant for any attempts by foreign actors to target or disrupt the ongoing vote counting and final certification of results”. He noted a report by Reuters which identified Twitter accounts falsely claiming to be part of the Associated Press, declaring election results before they were actually finalised – although the operators of those fake accounts are unknown at the moment.

US election 2020: As Trump-Biden goes to the wire, what happened when previous votes were close? https://t.co/k21jcPwwQ8  14:38 3m more people voted for Trump this time – so why is the result on a knife edge? Sky’s Alistair Bunkall explains the turnout is much higher this time round compared with four-years-ago which is why the distribution of votes on both sides is huge.The latest popular vote count: Joe Biden: 71,659,189 (50.5%)Donald Trump: 68,096,745 (48%)Joe Biden has received more votes than any US presidential candidate in history, beating Barack Obama’s previous record of 69,499,428. Donald Trump has expanded his margins in many rural and small town areas. Three million more people have voted for Mr Trump this time – and the votes are still being counted. “One of the reasons for this is that there was no meaningful – no disrespect to Kanye West – third party candidate this time,” says Bunkall. “Whereas in 2016, the Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson actually was reasonably successful in taking about 3% of the popular vote, which in turn had quite an impact on Hillary Clinton’s bid. “It is just interesting to look at the sheer numbers of people voting for both candidates this time and what that then tells you about American society. “When you consider the total turnout as we know it so far is just shy of 142 million – when some of these states are coming down to tens of thousands of votes, it’s remarkable,” adds Bunkall. 14:27Biden tweets ‘every vote must be counted’ Joe Biden is closing in on Donald Trump in the key battleground of Georgia, hoping to flip a third state from the Republicans and put himself within touching distancing of the White House. Only a handful of “toss up” states are left in play as he and Mr Trump vie for the crucial 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the US presidency. So far, Mr Biden is the closest on 253 – also leading in the popular vote and breaking the record for the most number of votes ever cast for a presidential candidate. Mr Trump has 214 Electoral College votes, also surpassing the number of total people who backed him in 2016 by more than three million. Despite election administrators’ appeals for patience and calm, the stakes have been significantly raised by Mr Trump’s campaign launching legal challenges. The president himself has threatened to take his fight to the Supreme Court over the election. And there have been mass demonstrations for every vote to be counted and counter-protests in states. Every vote must be counted. pic.twitter.com/kWLGRfeePK — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) November 5, 202014:17An update from the count in Georgia is expected later this afternoon13:46US votes counted as White House race heats up Sunrise on another day in DC – and we still don’t know who’s won the White House race The sun rises on another day here in Washington and still we await a result to an election that is getting closer and tighter by the hour.

Former assistant US attorney for southern district of Florida, David Weinstein, told Sky News’ Adam Boulton: “The issues that are presented and what’s going to get this up to the Supreme Court is the issue of the recount. “As far as the recounts go it is not even close in any of these states, certainly not within a margin of error. “His demands in Michigan as well as Pennsylvania that they be allowed to do the recounts – they are not even recounts at this point they are just counting the ballots. So the legs that they have to stand on are very shaky at this point.” He continued: “Certainly in those states where the margin of victory is in some states less than 1%, others less than 0.5%, they have a right to a recount. “But the margins that we are seeing across the board even if he succeeds in a recount he is not going to get the swing that he needs to accumulate enough votes to get the states he needs to push him over the top.” Asked what the point is of the legal challenges being mounted by the Trump campaign, he replied: “It is not so much about the legal merit of these issues. “The rhetoric that this president has been promoting throughout is that there was fraud and this election was stolen from him. By continuing to present this viewpoint by making these legal challenges it’s providing a rationale for his base to take his message forward after he loses this election, and to promote a rhetoric that says this was not a just result, and quite frankly, that’s not what’s happening here. “There was an overwhelming number of votes and that converts to the Electoral College votes.”12:46 Trump and Biden’s possible paths to power Here’s are Trump and Biden’s possible paths to power. 🇺🇸.

Pollsters were chastised for incorrectly predicting a large Hillary Clinton win in 2016, yet they have they have got it wrong again. Millions of dollars are spent on looking at who will win a US presidential election, and by how much. Ahead of this year’s election, Joe Biden was predicted a safe win, with the Democrat leading by up to 16 points a month before, which narrowed down to eight points the day before the election. It was to be the Democrats’ largest lead on the eve of an election since Bill Clinton in 1996, according to polling analysis website FiveThirtyEight. But, that has not been borne out by the results.

Portland Police said it arrested 11 people in the demonstrations after declaring riots in the city’s downtown area while the New York Police Department (NYPD) said it made about 50 arrests in protests that spread in the city late on Wednesday. “All of the gatherings that were declared riots were downtown. We have made 10 arrests”, a Portland Police spokesman told Reuters news agency. There were protests in other cities on Wednesday night as activists demanding that vote counts proceed unimpeded rallied in several cities, including Atlanta, Detroit, New York, and Oakland. Portland has seen several demonstrations since the death of George Floyd, particularly in the city’s downtown area, with protests occasionally turning into clashes between demonstrators and police as well as between right- and left-wing groups. The anti-racism protests have demanded an end to police brutality and racial inequality while the more recent demonstrations surrounding the election have demanded for a full count of the votes cast on Tuesday.

Sir Peter Westmacott held the post from 2012 to 2016 during the Obama-Biden Democratic presidency. Asked how he thought Mr Biden might now be feeling, he told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I suspect he will be feeling cautiously optimistic. “I do think that the Biden camp would have been a little bit disappointed, to put it mildly, yesterday morning when the big wins of Florida and Texas and so on just weren’t going their way. “And then the numbers looked like Trump. Trump then declared that he had won and it was a fraud – it wasn’t a big surprise, but it still was a bit of a shock. “But I think now as the postal votes are being counted… it has become clearer that the route to victory for Joe Biden is a much easier one than it is for Trump. Trump needs to sweep the whole table now if he is to win. “So I think the Biden camp will be feeling, ‘we are going to get this’ – either later today, or if we have to wait for Pennsylvania, tomorrow.” Former British ambassador to the US, Sir Peter Westmacott says "more Trump would probably be easier for the Prime Minister" when it comes to securing a US-UK trade agreement after #Brexit.Get the latest from the #USElection 👉 https://t.co/3DXPziJ1GM pic.twitter.com/eFaoGV4FXS Harris’s ancestral village in India gets festive as Biden leads count Villagers in the Indian ancestral home of Joe Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris have painted slogans on roads wishing her victory.

Trumps unfounded claims of electoral fraud ‘dangerous and irresponsible’ Donald Trump’s unfounded claims of electoral fraud are “historic, unprecedented and very dangerous”, former deputy assistant attorney general Lisa Graves tells Sky News. “These are the types of comments we have never heard from a president before in the entire history of the United States – someone who basically disregards the constitution which provides a significant amount of time for ballots to be counted and electors to be chosen.” She continues: “It’s just extraordinarily inappropriate and dangerous and irresponsible for the president to be claiming that he has the right to declare that the vote counting must stop if he is ahead, must go on if he is behind, and it is just more of the same that we have seen from him. “He doesn’t seem to have any real respect for the rule of law and he is determined to take this sort of scorched earth path.” 'Donald Trump's comments are certainly historic, they are unprecedented and they are dangerous.'Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Graves says it's "irresponsible" of the president to try and stop vote counting in two states.#KayBurley https://t.co/tVTIM5QKzj pic.twitter.com/atoPqbQ3nu 09:14 Trump launches legal action to halt vote counting in Pennsylvania and Michigan and asks for recount in Wisconsin President Donald Trump has launched legal action as he tries to temporarily stop vote counting in two states, including one that Joe Biden is projected to win, and wants a recount in a third where his election rival has apparently also triumphed.
