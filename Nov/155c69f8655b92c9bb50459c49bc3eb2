Conventional wisdom dictates that the true and sincere use of money reflects positively on whatever it accomplishes. It is therefore curious that the humongous votes dedicated as SECURITY VOTES at various levels of governance in this country cannot be juxtaposed against the high level of INSECURITY prevalent in Nigeria. One begins to wonder the general silence and apathy towards interrogation of its SINCERITY OF PURPOSE by the general public. SECURITY VOTES are huge, are clandestinely passed by the various statutory bodies, are not audited and are therefore MYSTERIOUS. It is therefore a sad commentary on a nation that should fight corruption by demonstrating TRANSPARENCY and ACCOUNTABILITY to continue to tow this path of UNCONSTITUTIONAL OPACITY. Alas, it does appear that we all look forward to the opportunity to ENJOY SECURITY VOTES, in a country virtually unwilling or unable to pay paltry minimum wages to its teeming workforce. Honestly I wish Nigerians could come to terms to appreciate how far this issue of security votes has permeated the entire Nigerian system and space. Recently the executive of the STUDENTS UNION GOVERNMENT [SUG] of one of our ever-striking tertiary institutions defended the security vote it dedicated for its leadership in their budget. You can then picture the manifestation within our LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS, STATE GOVERNMENTS and up to the CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. But the question remains: WHAT HAS BEEN THE SINCERITY OF PURPOSE AND THE ACCOMPLISHMENT? Let me confess that I was pained to have a glimpse at an answer to the above question when one of our penetrative electronic media broadcast a judgment passed in favour of a past DEPUTY GOVERNOR. According to the court, the sum of N180m will be paid to the Deputy Governor as OUTSTANDING SECURITY VOTES due to him from APRIL 2018 to August 2019. Fellow Nigerians, for someone who had left office, no matter the circumstance, should this payment be justifiable as an UNPAID ENTITLEMENT accruable to him/her? Has SECURITY VOTE turned to a REMUNERATION ALLOWANCE?For me this judgment speaks volumes in various ways, shapes and forms, and merely reminds me of the title of my book on value systems in Nigeria launched in 2012: “THE WAY WE ARE: Ideas for a better Nigeria.” But who listens?
