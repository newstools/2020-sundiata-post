 Nine abducted students of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria have been released after payment of ransom. News Express gathered that the students were released Saturday night after a million was paid as ransom for each of them. Already, friends, family members and well wishers have taken to their social media handles thanking God for their release. They had earlier intensified efforts to help in raising the ransom demanded by the kidnappers.
