A Nigerian lady has shared the details how she got a whopping N500,000 from a total stranger.  The woman with the Twitter handle, @Temmmmssss said she got the money from a random tweep after she tweeted that she needed such amount of money. The young lady took to the social media platform and wrote: “I need 500k God abeg.” Hours later, a random Twitter user slid into her DM to ask if he could transfer the money to her. @Temmmmssss shared screenshots of the conversation and the alert of N500,000 she received on her page. Nigerians took to the comment section of the post to share their thoughts. @sugarcapped wrote: “I’m very sure if it was a guy that said he needed 500k, nobody go even send him papa.” @camjah_miles commented: “Be transferring money from your one bank account to the other oo.
