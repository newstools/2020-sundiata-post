Senator Shehu Sani has dragged the Northern Governors for speaking against the recent #EndSARS protests against police brutality in the country but has chosen to remain silent after Boko Haram Insurgents murdered at least 110 people in Zabarmari village in northeast Borno state.  Among those who were killed in the horrific attack over the weekend, 43 farmers were beheaded. Senator Sani in his reaction on Twitter said the Northern Governors can now see the ‘location of their real problem.’ “Some weeks ago in Kaduna,Northern Governors said #EndSARS protests was their problem;Now with 110 decapitations they can see the location of their real problem”.
