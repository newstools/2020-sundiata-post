Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona has died after suffering a heart attack in his home country. The 60-year-old is said to have passed away at home this afternoon. Maradona, who has struggled with health problems in recent years, underwent brain surgery last month. The former Barcelona star was pictured in recent weeks after the surgery, reportedly on the mend. Flocks of fans turned up at an Argentinian hospital in recent weeks to wish their hero well as he battled to survive the brain. They turned up with flags and banners, while they chanted his name in support. Maradona only turned 60 last week, but suffered a torrid birthday as he watched Gimnasia, the Argentinian team he was manager of, but suffering health problems and had to be escorted from the sidelines. Since leaving hospital, it is said the football icon had been in rehab for alcohol dependency. “Diego has gone through maybe the most difficult moment of his life and I think it was a miracle that they found this bleeding in his brain that could have cost him his life,” his lawyer said. Maradona also shocked fans by appearing at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, being held up by close friends as he watched the event in Moscow. Football fans flocked to social media to mourn the news this afternoon. “Reports from Argentina that Diego Armando Maradona has died. By some distance the best player of my generation and arguably the greatest of all time. After a blessed but troubled life, hopefully he’ll finally find some comfort in the hands of God,” said Gary Lineker. Maradona is considered by many as the greatest football player in history. He scored the World Cup’s two most famous goals – both in the same match against England. His ‘Hand of God’ is still talked about to this day, while his stunning run from inside his own half during the 1986 game has won many votes on the competition’s greatest goal. Source
