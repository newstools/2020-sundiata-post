Nigerian singer, Lil Frosh, has denied the allegation that he assaulted Gift Camille, his girlfriend. Last month, Mayoks Michael, Camille’s manager, and brother had taken to his Twitter handle to accuse Lil Frosh of domestic violence against his sister. This had prompted a heated backlash and widespread condemnation among both prominent celebrities and fans. As a result of this, Davido Music Worldwide (DMW), a record label owned by Davido, had ended its contract with Lil Frosh. The DMW brand boss had also stated that there was no excuse for the actions of the accused. But on Tuesday, the teaser for a detailed interview wherein Lil Frosh shared his side of the story surfaced. Lil Frosh also claimed his girlfriend had complained to him that she was having an allergy that caused her face to swell up and inflicted a boil right behind her left ear. He said the condition only worsened over time. “I didn’t do it. I didn’t beat this girl up. She’s my girlfriend. She called me saying she noticed she’s having a boil at the back of her ear. I asked what it was and she said maybe it’s an allergic reaction,” the singer explained. Watch the video below;
