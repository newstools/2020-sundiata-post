The governor of Bayelsa state, Douye Diri has been called out by veteran musician, Charly Boy for ignoring a first class graduate and appointing an ex-BBNaija housemate, Rebecca Nengi Hampson as political aide.  He said such an act is wrong and a true reflection of a misplaced priority. Nengi recently got an appointment for the role of a Senior Special Adviser to the governor and was also made the Face of Bayelsa and role model to the Bayelsa State girl child. Unhappy with the development, Charly Boy took to Instagram to share his opinion which he titled ‚ÄòTHE IRONY OF THE NIGERIAN STATE‚Äô He wrote: ‚ÄúThe young lady with white is a first-class graduate of the Niger Delta University, Faculty of Law, as well as a first-class graduate Nigeria Law School‚Ä¶ she was not honoured by her Bayelsa State Government‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIn another development, a girl, who is alleged to be a Third Class Graduate and a participant (A Runner Up) in the ‚ÄúBig Brother Naija‚Äù show, was given a state reception and was also honoured with a government appointment and was also declared the role model to the Bayelsa State Girl Child (the Face of the Bayelsa Girl Child). ‚ÄúWhat an irony and a misplacement of moral priority! ‚ÄúMeanwhile, congratulations to our lawyer, the True Face of the Bayelsa Girl Child, as far as I and every other realist, is concerned.‚Äù Aside Nengi, fellow Season 5 Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Tricky Tee also got an appointment from the Bayelsa State governor.
